  c. the csp controls the service according to the request from the csn: cloud service 
broker and replies with a result of control to the csn: cloud service broker.  
  d. the csn: cloud service broker verifies the control request is correctly performed.  
  e. through the csb workspace, the csc is notified that the request has been 
performed. 
(8)  during the service period, the csc makes a request to the csn: cloud service broker to 
stop and terminate the service. 
  a. the csn: cloud service broker records the termination request information from 
the csc. 
  b. the csn: cloud service broker makes a termination request to the csp, who is

  c. the csp stops and terminates the service according to the request from csn: cloud 
service broker and replies with a result of termination to the csn: cloud service 
broker. 
  d  the csn: cloud service broker verifies the service is correctly terminated.
