8.4.4 data management requirements 
– man-006: a vscs system is required to support data management in the cloud, including adding, 
deleting, browsing, indexing, searching. 
8.4.5 system management requirements 
– man-007: a vscs system is required to provide a unified system management interface which can 
be called conveniently. 
– man-008: a vscs system is required to provide a visual interface for users. 
8.4.6 operation management requirements 
– man-009: a vscs system is required to monitor, record and display the running status of the system. 
8.5 scalability requirements 
– sca-001: a vscs system is required to provide storage resource scalability. when the storage 
equipment is increased or decreased in the system, the storage capacity is increased or decreased 
accordingly, and the system service is uninterrupted. 
– sca-002: a vscs system is required to provide storage space scalability for users. the storage space 
of individual users can be increased or decreased according to each user's demands. 
– sca-003: a vscs system is required to provide user scalability. the number of supported users can 
be increased or decreased dynamically. 
8.6 reliability requirements 
– rel-001: a vscs system is required to ensure service reliability. when storage equipment fails or 
the storage system network operation is abnormal, the system service can be used normally. 
– rel-002: a vscs system is required to ensure data reliability. when data is destroyed, the system 
can recover it based on the data protection mechanism, e.g., data backup, data coding. 
8.7 performance requirements 
– per-001: a vscs system is required to support concurrent user operations. the system can serve a 
large number of users simultaneously, while ensuring the service quality.
