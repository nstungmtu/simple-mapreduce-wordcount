intercloud and interoperability 5 
 
  923 
interoperability stretches beyond the cloud services themselves and also includes the interaction of the csc 
with the cloud service management facilities of the cloud service provider (csp). ideally, the csc should have 
a consistent and interoperable interface to the cloud service management functionality and be able to 
interact with two or more csps without needing to deal with each provider in a specialized way.

5.1.7 itu-t 
the itu telecommunication standardization sector (itu-t) is one of the three sectors (divisions or units) of 
the international telecommunication union (itu); it coordinates standards for telecommunications. 
cloud computing is an important part of itu-t study group (sg) 13 work and the group develops standards 
that detail requirements and functional architectures of the cloud computing ecosystem, covering inter- and 
intra-cloud computing and technologies supporting x as a service (xaas). 
itu-t works on definition, cloud computing management interface related aspects of cci. 
this work of sg  13 includes infrastructure and networking aspects of cloud computing models, as well as 
deployment considerations and requirements for interoperability and data portability. 
sg 13 also develops standards enabling consistent end-to-end, multi-cloud management and monitoring of 
services exposed by and across different service providers' domains and technologies.

5.1.8 nist 
the national institute of standards and technology (nist) is a measurement standards laboratory, also 
known as a national metrological institute (nmi), which is a non -regulatory agency of the united states 
department of commerce. 
nist standards acceleration to jumpstart the adoption of cloud computing (sajacc) working group: focused 
on use case definition and refinement to produce testable cloud computing scenarios.
