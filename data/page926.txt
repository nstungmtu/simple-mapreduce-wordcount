4 introduction 
the purpose of this supplement is to provide the list of existing cloud computing interoperability and testing 
related activities. c lause 5  describes cloud computing interoperability activities  by different standards 
development organizations (sdos) while clause 6 identifies  potential cloud computing  interoperability 
testing areas. this supplement is intended to be of help for developing cloud computing interoperability 
testing recommendations.  
5 existing cloud computing interoperability activities 
5.1 standards development organizations for cloud computing interoperability 
many sdos are developing cloud standards. some of them are listed in itu-t fg-cloud technical reports. 
from an interoperability testing perspective, some sdos do not conduct testing themselves but conduct 
joint/collaborative/sponsored testing groups as described in clause 5.2. for example, distributed 
management task force (dmtf), european telecommunications standards institute (etsi), organization for 
the a dvancement of structured information s tandards (oasis), storage networking industry a ssociation 
(snia) and some sdos sponsored cloud plugfest as part of the cloud interoperability week where, during 
the testing of specifications, they improved such cloud standards as cloud data management i nterface 
(cdmi), open cloud computing interface (occi), cloud infrastructure management interface (cimi) and open
