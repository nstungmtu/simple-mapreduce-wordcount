figure iii.4 – inter-cloud view including saas cscs 
in figure iii.4, the iaas csp (right side of the figure) provides vms for the saas csp in order to provide its saas 
application for saas cscs (left side of the figure). in this case, the saas cscs use the saas application provided 
by the saas csp. the saas csp uses vms, which are provided by iaas csps, on which the sa as application is 
executed. some of the actual vms are provided by the primary csp, and some are provided by the secondary 
csps.  
figure iii.5 shows the same service offering in a different representation.
