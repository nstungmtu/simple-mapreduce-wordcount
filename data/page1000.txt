this recommendation describes data security requirements for the monitoring service of cloud computing. 
the recommendation analyses data security threats and challenges associated with the monitoring service 
in a cloud computing environment, and describes data security requirements of the monitoring service 
including data scope, data lifecycle, data acquisition and data storage. this recommendation can be used by 
cloud service providers (csps) who provide monitoring services to cloud service customers (cscs).
