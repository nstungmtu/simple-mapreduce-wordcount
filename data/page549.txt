table i.7 â€“ csc data policy implementation in inter-cloud 
figure (optional) 
 
pre-conditions (optional) the csp (naas) has an inter-cloud relationship with two csps (paas), i.e., csp1 (paas) 
and csp2 (paas). 
the csp (naas) respects data policy. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
the csp (naas) supports inter-cloud data policy management. 
the idpap acts as access control for the csc data policy and delivers policies to the 
idpip. 
the idpip stores data policies provided by the csc. 
the idpdp selects the policy on the basis of collected information about data processing 
and usage among peer csps. 
the idpdp decides which csp processes and uses vhgw data. 
the idpep implements decisions of the idpdp in the inter-cloud environment.

i.8 use case of data placement policies for data-intensive applications in the inter-cloud 
environment 
this use case illustrates data placement policies for data-intensive applications in inter-cloud. the inter-cloud 
federation pattern used to illustrate the use case is an example only.
