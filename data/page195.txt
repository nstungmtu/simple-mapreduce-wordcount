7.3 operation requirements 
– processing unit operation : it is recommended that a physical machine provides operations for 
processing units, such as power operation, monitoring configuration information of each processing 
units. 
note 1 – the power operation for a processing unit is to control the power status (e.g., power on, power off and restart) 
of each of the processing units. the monitoring configuration information of processing units is to collect and report the 
parameters of the processing units (e.g., cpu type, cpu clock speed, memory frequency and stor age capacity). 
– remote management : it is recommended that a physical machine supports to be managed 
remotely through network. 
note 2 – examples of remote management of physical machine are power operation, firmware update and log querying 
for the physical machine remotely. 
– diagnostic of physical machine: it is recommended that a physical machine supports diagnostic to 
analyze before and after a hardware fault as well as firmware and components of physical machine 
changes. 
note 3 – the fault prediction is accomplished by software. 
7.4 scalability requirements 
– expansion of interconnect network: it is recommended that a physical machine provides external 
expansion of the interconnect network among multiple physical machines to meet required 
computing performance level from a csu. 
– i/o interface for device extensions : it is recommended that a physical machine provides an i/o 
interface for device extensions that can be used to extend high performance network cards, graphics 
card and so forth. 
– processing unit replacement: it is recommended that a physical machine supports substitution with 
other processing units to allow processing unit upgrade. 
– adding processing units: it is recommended that a physical machine supports the addition of more 
processing units to the physical machine. 
– adding components of processing units : it is recommended that a physical machine supports the 
addition of more components to the processing units, including cpu, memory, storage and i/o 
device. 
– adding power sup ply: it is recommended that a physical machine supports the addition of more 
power supply components to the physical machine. 
– adding cooling component : it is recommended that a physical machine supports the addition of  
more cooling components to the physical machine. 
7.5 security requirements 
– no additional ports: it is recommended that a physical machine does not expose network ports that 
are not used. 
– authorized access: it is recommended that a physical machine supports an authorized access.  
7.6 reliability requirement 
– support fault location: it is recommended that a physical machine supports fault location, so that 
the operator can easily replace the failing components. 
– hot-plug support: a physical machine can optionally support hot-plug without damage. 
note – hot-plug is plugging in and out some components of the physical machine while it is running. an example of 
hot-plug support is hot -plug disk. hot -plug disk refer to the disks supporting plug in to or plug out from the physical 
machine without damage while the physical machine is running.
