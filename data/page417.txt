• iso/iec tr 23186: this document describes a framework of trust for the processing of multi-sourced 
data that includes data use obligations and controls, data provenance, chain of custody, security 
and immutable proof of compliance as elements of the framework.

• iso/iec tr 23187 : this document provides an overview and discussion of interactions between 
cloud service partners (csns), specifically cloud service brokers, cloud service developers and cloud 
service auditors, and other cloud service entities. in addition, the document describes how cloud 
service agreements (csas) and cloud service level agreements (slas) should be used to address 
those interactions including the following: 
– define terms and concepts and provide an overview for interactions between cloud service 
partners (csns) and cloud service customers (cscs) and cloud service providers (csps);  
– description of types of csn interactions; 
– description of interactions between csns and cscs; 
– description of interactions between csns and csps; 
– elements of csas and cloud slas for csn interactions, both with csps and with cscs.

• iso/iec tr 23188: the scope of this technical report is to investigate and report on the concept of 
edge computing, its relationship to cloud computing and iot, and the technologies that are key to 
the implementation of edge computing. this report will explore the following topics with respect to 
edge computing:  
– concept of edge computing systems; 
– architectural foundation of edge computing; 
– edge computing terminology; 
– software classifications in edge computing – for example: firmware, services, applications;  
– supporting technologies such as containers, serverless, microservices; 
– networking for edge systems, including virtual networks; 
– data – data flow, data storage, data processing in edge computing; 
– management – of software, of data and of networks, resources, quality of service; 
– virtual placement of software and data, and metadata; 
– security and privacy; 
– real time; 
– mobile edge computing, mobile devices.

to build applications and systems using cloud computing. these include: 
– virtual machines (vms) and hypervisors; 
– containers and container management systems; 
– "serverless" computing; 
– microservices architecture and automation; 
– platform as a service systems and their architecture; 
– storage services; 
– security, scalability and networking as applied to the above cloud computing technologies.
