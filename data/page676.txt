6 overview of naas functional architecture 
6.1 key naas characteristics 
the naas functional architecture aims for a scalable and programmable on -demand network allowing the 
cloud service customer (csc) to provision network services (nss) and resources, as needed, automatically or 
with minimal interaction with the naas cloud service provider (csp). key naas characteristics to be achieved 
include: 
– self-service: the ability to manage network services automatical ly or with minimal human 
interaction. examples include self-provisioning, self-care and self-design; 
– on-demand: the ability to deploy and adjust (increase or decrease) network services rapidly and as 
needed. examples include fast time -to-market, try befo re you buy, accelerate innovation, eas y 
migration, update and upgrade; 
– scalability: the ability to scale network services and resources (scale out, in, up or down) in response 
to a large usage demand. example includes scale-up resources based on traffic growth; 
– programmability: the ability to access services features through application programming interfaces 
(apis). examples include programmable quality of service (qos) and network policy rules; 
– measured service : metered delivery of services such tha t usage can be monitored, controlled, 
reported, and charged. example includes case of naas cscs charged only for the services or 
resources that they use.
