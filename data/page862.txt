table i.3 – selecting csp by reputation-based trust evaluation 
figure (optional) 
 
pre-conditions (optional) – all of csp2(saas), csp3(saas) and csp4(saas) can provide the service s csp1 
needs. 
– csp1 has an internal trust evaluation system. 
– there is a third-party trust evaluation system. 
post-conditions (optional) – csp1 establishes a trust relationship with csp2(saas) and provides service to 
the csc with an inter-cloud intermediary pattern. 
derived requirements – inter-cloud reputation-based trust evaluation (refer to clause 7.3). 
i.4 use case of sso authentication within inter-cloud environment  
this use case illustrates sso authentication in inter-cloud. the federation pattern of inter -cloud used to 
illustrate the use case is an example only. 
 
table i.4 – sso authentication within inter-cloud environment 
title sso authentication within inter-cloud environment 
description – the csc requests saas service x from csp1(saas); 
– the csps(saas) form inter-cloud federation pattern among them. the service x is integrated 
from services provided by csp1(saas), csp2(saas) and csp3(saas); 
– each csp has its own identity management system, and the csc is not willing to be 
authenticated more than one time when accessing saas service x;  
– there is a trusted third-party sso system which provides a certification service to certify 
credentials on behalf of all parties in the federation. with this sso mechanism, the csc is able 
to access various saas services offered by different csps once it is successfully authenticated by 
any member of the federation; 
– each csp supports a periodical verification mechanism to check if the csc still ha s the privilege 
to access the csp's service.
