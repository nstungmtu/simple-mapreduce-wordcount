table i.1 – mapping of inter-cloud computing functional requirements  
and inter-cloud functions 
functional requirements specified in [itu-t y.3511] inter-cloud functions in this 
recommendation 
9.4 resource 
discovery 
and 
reservation 
allow the reservation of discovered  resources in the 
peer csps. 
– 7.3.5 inter-cloud service reservation 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.4 resource 
discovery 
and 
reservation 
allow provisional reservation of discovered resources, 
i.e., to keep the resources to be used (as candidates), for 
later acknowledgement (for some of them) or release 
(for others). 
– 7.3.5 inter-cloud service reservation 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.4 resource 
discovery 
and 
reservation 
allow finding of available resources in the peer csps 
based on different priorities. 
– 7.3.3 inter-cloud service discovery 
– 7.3.4 inter-cloud service selection 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.4 resource 
discovery 
and 
reservation 
allow reservation of available resources in the peer csps 
on the basis of different priorities 
– 7.3.5 inter-cloud service reservation 
– 7.3.4 inter-cloud service selection 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.5 resource 
set-up and 
activation 
the resource set-up and activation capability deals with 
the set up and activation of reserved resources in the 
peer csps. this includes connecting to the peer csps via 
networks, remotely activating (i.e., invoking) software 
and transferring or copying data to enable the use of 
resources in the peer csps. 
– 7.2.2 service provisioning 
– 7.2.8 peer service management 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
– 7.4.1 authentication and identity 
management 
– 7.4.2 authorization and security policy 
management 
– 7.4.3 encryption management 
9.5 resource 
set-up and 
activation 
allow the establishment of reserved resources in a peer 
csp. 
– 7.2.2 service provisioning 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.5 resource 
set-up and 
activation 
allow accessing to the configuration and policy settings 
of reserved resources in the peer csps. 
– 7.2.2 service provisioning 
– 7.2.8 peer service management 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.6 cloud 
services 
switchover 
and 
switchback 
allow switching over of csc end-user access to a peer 
csp (acting as primary csp) without manual operation 
from the csc, in order to allow the csc end user to use 
services in a similar manner to the way they did before 
the access was switched over. 
allow switching back of csc end-user access to the 
primary csp when this csp has recovered from the 
reasons that led to the switchover (e.g., a disaster or 
load distribution between peer csps is no longer 
needed).  
– 7.3.1 peer csp management 
– 7.2.7 incident and problem 
management 
– 7.2.5 service automation 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
– 7.4.1 authentication and identity 
management 
– 7.4.2 authorization and security policy 
management 
– 7.4.3 encryption management 
9.7 resource 
release 
allow updating of the peer csp resource configuration 
information. 
– 7.2.3 monitoring and reporting 
– 7.2.8 peer service management 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.7 resource 
release 
allow releasing by the csp of resources reserved, 
activated or set up in the peer csps. 
– 7.3.6 inter-cloud service release 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation
