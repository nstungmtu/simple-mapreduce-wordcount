end-to-end naas connectivity given to a csc '', ''support logically centralized management and control view 
of networking resources'', ''provide network connectivity services using unified sla for csc's management of 
multiple optimized networks in order to simplify and unify the control and management of networks '', and 
''leverage transport networks dynamically form multiple choices of physical and virtualized networks for the 
purpose of providing network connectivity services '', which requires naas architecture to provide the 
dedicated mechanism to present a panorama portal to the  naas csc, allowing a unified abs tract service 
modelling repository to receive, parse, and transfer naas csc's requirement to the control function of specific 
domain, which is implemented separately with other parallel control function of dedicated domains. using 
this manner, it is feasible to realize the composite naas service, which can be decomposed automatically and 
dispatched to the appropriated control function. 
take the use case for dynamic transport network, specified in [itu -t y.3512], as an example, it is a typical 
composite naas  service, which  requires the service management related function to separate the 
requirement composition into independent service model and distribute them to the independent network 
control functions. 
i.3 mapping and derivation of functionalities for network analytics, policy, and autonomy 
regarding the requirement ''optimized and fine-grained traffic engineering'' in [itu-t y.3512], whose detailed 
description includes ''collect near real -time utilization metrics and topology data from its own network 
equipment'', ''provide the csc with fine-grained view on usage of network resources'', ''control the network 
resource allocation by reconfiguring network profiles as well as properties (e.g., topology, bandwidth) in 
response to dynamically changing  traffic demands '', which r equires naas architecture provide analytical 
mechanism to collect near real-time data from naas csp's network environment, maintain monitoring naas 
service during its lifecycle, trigger the corresponding pre -defined action based on the matched specific 
condition. 
in order to perform the closed analysis and control loop in naas service lifecycle management mentioned 
above, it is also needed for naas architecture to provide configurable policy mechanism, covering policy 
creation, policy distribution, and policy decision and enforcement. 
based on the analytical and policy mechanisms, autonomy at resource level of naas architecture can be 
achieved accordingly. 
i.4 mapping and derivation of functionality for mapping between physical and virtualized networks 
on the one hand, the ''overlay network mechanism'', ''logically isolated network partition'', and ''overlapped 
private ip addresses '' functional requirements, whose detailed description includes ''support virtualized 
overlay networks on top of the physical underlay network'', ''implement linp'', and ''allows different cscs to 
use their own private ip addresses even when the subnet addresses are overlapped '' can be satisfied by 
virtualized overlay network mechanism, e.g. , virtual extensible local area n etwork (vxlan), vpn. on the 
other hand, the ''optimized and fine-grained traffic engineering'' functional requirement asks for ''naas csp 
provides the csc with fine-grained view on usage of network resource''. if the network resource mentioned 
here consists of not o nly physical network, but also virtualized network, which are always implemented by 
tunnelling overlay mechanism, the naas csc cannot obtain the near real -time utilization on physical 
networks. because the virtualized network is overlaid over the physical networks, and shields the underlying 
information to the naas csc, this results in possible underutilization/overutilization of resource. 
hence, naas architecture needs  to provide the mapping between physical underlay network and virtual 
overlay network in order to present fine-grained view on usage of physical network resource. 
i.5 mapping and derivation of functionalities for an evolved real-time oss 
the ''operation and management'', ''performance'' and ''service chain'' requirements for naas applications 
described in clause 7 of [itu-t y.3512] imply that functionalities for performance management as well as for 
flexible provisioning and configuration of naa s applications and their chaining h ave to be supported by 
the oss.
