• itu-t y. 3506: cloud service brokerage is a service that arbitrates, delivers and manages cloud 
services provided by cloud serv ice providers for cloud service customers. this recommendation 
provides the functional requirements of cloud service brokerage. to provide functional 
requirements for cloud service brokerage, this recommendation specifies an overview and includes 
a service model and configuration of cloud service brokerage. various use cases are also identified 
to derive the functional requirements.

• itu-t y.mlaas-reqts: this recommendation provides cloud computing requirements for machine 
learning as a service, which addresses capabilities, and requirements from use cases. machine 
learning as a service (mlaas) is a cloud service ca tegory to support the development and 
applications of machine learning in the cloud computing environments. on the perspective of cloud 
computing service provisioning, this recommendation defines the capabilities and functional 
requirements for mlaas to id entify functionalities such as data gathering, machine learning 
modelling and computing resources, etc. this is fundamentally aligned with the cloud computing 
reference architecture of [itu-t y.3502].  
 note – developments of machine learning algorithms an d methodology are out of the scope of this 
recommendation.

– itu-t y.baas-reqts: recommendation itu-t y. baas-reqts provides the functional requirements for 
blockchain as a service (baas) in the cloud computing environment. blockchain technologies use 
decentralized, shared, immutable ledgers to store data and record transactions histo ry, by which 
the trust, accountability, transparency and efficiency can be achieved. blockchain technologies 
include p2p networking, consensus mechanism, smart contract and cipher algorithms, which are 
now driving various emerging applications across a wid e range, such as digital cryptocurrency, 
finance, insurance, banking, healthcare, government, manufacturing, retail, legal, media and 
entertainment, supply chain and logistics, accounting, notarization and certification.
