mapping of inter-cloud computing functional requirements and functions 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this appendix aims to describe the mapping of inter -cloud computing functional requirements specified in 
[itu-t y.3511] and inter-cloud functions in clause 7 of this recommendation.  
table i.1 – mapping of inter-cloud computing functional requirements  
and inter-cloud functions 
functional requirements specified in [itu-t y.3511] inter-cloud functions in this 
recommendation 
9.1 sla and 
policy 
negotiation 
the sla and policy negotiation capability is required to 
be aware of the sla information related to the qos and 
performance aspects of the csps involved in the inter-
cloud using standard formats. 
– 7.3.1 peer csp management 
– 7.2.4 service policy management 
– 7.2.6 service level management 
– 7.2.8 peer service management 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.2 resource 
monitoring 
allow describing and expressing of the resource 
information (e.g., resource type, configuration and 
status) in a standard manner in order to be able to 
monitor these resources across multiple csps. 
– 7.2.8 peer service management 
– 7.3.2 inter-cloud service negotiation 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.2 resource 
monitoring 
allow updating of the resource information across 
multiple csps in synchronization with the events (e.g., 
reserve or release of resources) involving the csps. 
– 7.2.8 peer service management 
– 7.2.3 monitoring and reporting 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.2 resource 
monitoring 
allow periodically, or on a request basis, collecting of 
information about the usage and performance status of 
the resources of multiple csps. 
– 7.2.3 monitoring and reporting 
– 7.2.8 peer service management 
– 7.3.2 inter-cloud service negotiation 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.2 resource 
monitoring 
allow periodically, or on a request basis, collecting of 
information about the resource availability (e.g., dead or 
alive status of machines) of multiple csps. 
– 7.2.3 monitoring and reporting 
– 7.2.8 peer service management 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.2 resource 
monitoring 
allow exchange of  monitoring information in commonly 
defined ways across multiple csps.  
– 7.2.3 monitoring and reporting 
– 7.2.8 peer service management 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.3 resource 
performance 
estimation 
and selection 
the resource performance estimation and selection 
capability deals with the selection of resources from the 
candidate resources that have already been reserved in 
peer csps. this capability estimates the achievable 
performance of available reserved resources and assists 
the csp in the selection of resources to be effectively 
used.  
– 7.2.8 peer service management 
– 7.3.4 inter-cloud service selection 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.4 resource 
discovery 
and 
reservation 
allow finding of available resources in the peer csps 
based on different priorities. 
allow reservation of available resources in the peer csps 
on the basis of different priorities 
– 7.3.2 inter-cloud service negotiation 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation 
9.4 resource 
discovery 
and 
reservation 
enable discovery of resources available in the peer csps. – 7.3.3 inter-cloud service discovery 
– 7.3.7 inter-cloud capabilities adaptation
