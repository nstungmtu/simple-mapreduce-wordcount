(14) after receiving the data source address, the csau requests the mdu to start the image uploading 
from the pu. 
(15) the mdu sends a request to the pu for obtaining the captured images. 
(16) the pu creates an image transmission channel with the mdu and sends the captured images to the 
mdu. 
(17) the mdu transfers the images to the csau. 
(18) the csau transfers the images to the csdu to store the received images in the cloud data nodes. 
(19) when the storage plan is completed, the cu sends a stop request to the csau. 
(20) the csau transfers this stop request to the mdu. 
(21) the mdu returns a response to the csau. 
(22) the csau requests the scu to disconnect. 
(23) the scu returns a response to end the image uploading from the pu. 
7.4.4 video metadata or image metadata storage 
the intelligent visual surveillance system can provide various intelligent services by using video or image 
analysis technologies. one solution is to implement some intelligent visual analysis algorithms in the pu that 
is defined as the intelligent premises unit (ipu). when a user wants to store video metadata or image 
metadata extracted from the original video or image data in the cloud storage system,  the cu initiates a 
request to the scu to start this procedure.
