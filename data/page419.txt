• dsp0217: the "system management architecture for server hardware (smash) implementation 
requirements" specifies the cim profile implementation requirements needed for conformance 
with smash 2.0. 
 uri: http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/dsp0217_2.1.0.pdf 
• dsp0243: the "open virtualization format (ovf) specification" describes an open, secure, portable 
and extensible format for the packaging and distribution of software for execution in virtual 
machines across multiple virtualization platforms. this specification is recognized by incits (469 -
2010) and iso/iec (17203:2011).

 version 2.1.1 of this document extends the format definition to support network ports, scaling at 
deployment time , basic placement policies, encryption of ovf packages , runtime d isk sharing, 
advanced boot order , advanced data transfer to guest os , improved internationalization – i18n, 
improved hash and cim schema.

• dsp0262: the "cloud auditing data federation (cadf) data format and interface definitions 
specification" document specifies a data model and associated schema definitions to format event 
records, logs and reports that can be federated and are suitable for audit purposes. 
 uri: http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/dsp0262_1.0.0.pdf 
• dsp0263: the "cloud infrastructure management interface (cimi) model and rest interface over 
http" specifies the model and protocol for management interactions between the provider of a 
cloud infrastructure as a service (iaas) and a consumer of that service. the model includes machines, 
storage and networks within the iaas provider which the iaas consumer can perform life cycle 
management. 
 uri: http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/dsp0263_1.0.1.pdf 
• dsp0264: the "cloud infrastructure management interface - common information model" specifies 
a cim represe ntation for the logical model contained in the "cloud infrastructure management 
interface" document (dsp0263). 
 uri: http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/dsp0264_1.0.0.pdf 
• dsp0266: the "redfish scalable platform management api specification" document specifies 
restful interface semantics to access the data defined in model format to perform out -of-band 
systems management. it is suitable for a wide range of servers, from standalone servers to rack 
mount and bladed environments but scales equally well for large-scale cloud environments.
