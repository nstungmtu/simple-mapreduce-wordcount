appendix i 
 
use case of infrastructure as a service 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this appendix includes iaas related use cases including an infrastructure level us e case, and computing , 
storage and network service use cases.  
i.1  use case template 
the use cases developed in this appendix should adopt the following unified format for better readability and 
convenient material organization. 
use case 
name  title of the use case  
abstract  description for overview and feature of the use case 
roles  roles relating to or appearing in the use case 
figure  figure to present the use case (uml-like diagram is suggested for clarifying relations 
between roles but it is not mandatory) 
pre-conditions 
(optional)  
the pre-conditions represent the necessary conditions or use cases that should be achieved 
before starting to describe the use case. as dependency may exist among different use 
cases, such a description can help others to understand relation among the use cases.  
post-conditions 
(optional)  
similar to that for pre-conditions, the post-conditions describe conditions or use cases that 
will be carried out after the termination of currently describing use case. such an inter -use 
case dependency clarification improves the collaboration of use cases.  
description description introduces the detail information of the use case, such as the processes or 
major steps. it is helpful for the reader to better understand it.  
requirements  requirements (titles) derived from the use case. for example; 
â€“ large-scale migration: a csp in the inter-cloud federation is required to be able to 
guarantee continuity of all the services in this csp by large-scale service migration with 
minimum impact during a desired period. it is recommended to consider priority of 
services when migrating.
