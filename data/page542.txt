9.2 secure data management of the saas replication model in inter-cloud 
it is required that the csp provide functionalities of data integrity management to check whether the data is 
identical to that of other csps. 
it is recommended that the csp provide to cscs secure application program interfaces (apis) to access saas 
securely. 
9.3 secure data management of the saas partition model in inter-cloud 
it is required that the csp provide functionalities for data identity management for software logic to find 
appropriate data and avoid data duplication among saass. 
it is recommended that the csp provide cloud storage support data encryption functionalities to protect data. 
9.4 secure data management of the saas data partition model in inter-cloud 
it is required that the csp provide merging functionalitie s to incorporate new data into an already existing 
dataset. 
it is recommended that the csp provide functionalities for integrated key management among csps so that 
encryption/decryption saas data can merge. 
10 security considerations 
security aspects for c onsideration within the cloud -computing environment, including inter -cloud 
computing, are addressed by security challenges for csps as descr ibed in [itu -t x.1601], which analyses 
security threats and challenges, and describes security capabilities that could mitigate these threats and meet 
the security challenges.
