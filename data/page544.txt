figure (optional) 
 
pre-conditions (optional) the csps (saas) forms an inter-cloud federation pattern. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
the csps (saas) implement data use policy in their management system.  
derived requirements inter-cloud data use policies (refer to clause 9.1). 
i.3 use case of secure data management of the saas replication model in inter-cloud 
this use case illustrates secure data management of the saas replication model in inter -cloud. the inter-
cloud federation pattern used to illustrate the use case is an example only. 
table i.3 – secure data management of the saas replication model in inter-cloud 
title secure data management of the saas replication model in inter-cloud 
description the saas replication model, deployed on multiple csps, that combines software logic 
and data into one service enables the user to get evidence of the integrity of the result 
among multiple csps in order to guarantee that an operation performed in a cloud 
system has not been tampered with by the csp or attackers.
