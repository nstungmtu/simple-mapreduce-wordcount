9.2 iso/iec jtc 1 
in november 2014, the iso/iec joint technical committee 1 ( jtc 1) established working group (wg) 9 
[b-jtc 1] on big data to: 
− serve as the focus of, and proponent for, big data standardization; 
− develop foundational standards for big data – including reference architecture and vocabulary 
standards – for guiding big data efforts throughout jtc 1 upon which other standards can be 
developed; 
− develop other big data standards that build on the foundational standards when relevant jtc  1 
subgroups, that could address these standards, do not exist or are unable to develop them. 
− identify gaps in big data standardization; 
− develop and maintain liaisons with all relevant jtc 1 entities as well as with any other jtc 1 subgroup 
that may propose work related to big data in the future; 
− identify jtc 1 (and other organization) entities that are developing standards an d related material 
that contribute to big data, and where appropriate, investigate ongoing and potential new work that 
contributes to big data; 
− engage with the community outside of jtc 1 to grow the awareness of and encourage engagement 
in jtc 1 big data standardization efforts within jtc 1, forming liaisons as is needed. 
jtc 1 subcommittee (sc) 27 has been developing standards for the protection of information and ict, which 
include generic methods, techniques and guidelines to address aspects of both security and privacy. security 
and privacy is one of the cross cutting aspect on ict, and the activities of sc 27 can be applied to the area of 
big data as well.
