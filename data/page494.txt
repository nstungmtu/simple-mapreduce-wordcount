comprehensive view of management layers 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
figure i.1 is an attempt at desc ribing the management layers and how the service management interface 
(smis) for each layer correlate with each other to offer a complete picture. the cloud computing data centre 
implementation layers are depicted by la rge circles parallel to each other. t he smis are depicted by small 
blue circles containing the information required by the management system in order to achieve a holistic 
view of the entire operation. the straight lines between each plane show the flow of  information and 
relationship between what is happening at each layer, depicting how each layer is related to and affected by, 
the neighbouring one. looking at the diagram in its entirety helps the viewer to realize why it makes sense 
to expose consistent smis from each layer and to expose ma nagement information and telemetry in a 
consistent matter that can then be rolled up into a comprehensive diagnostics and management solution 
that can be used by a telecom operator offering and consuming cloud services and products.
