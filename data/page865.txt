functionalities for managing isolation and security mechanism 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this appendix provides functionalities for managing isolation and security mechanisms. 
ii.1 functionalities for managing isolation and security mechanism 
the functionalities for managing isolation and security mechanisms are supported by the 'authentication and 
identity management'', ''authorization and sec urity policy  management'', ''encryption management'' and 
''platform and virtualization man agement'' functional components within the multi -layer functions of the 
cloud computing reference architecture [itu-t y.3502]. the positioning of these functionalities for managing 
isolation and security mechanism s across the csps , which provide inter -cloud services , is presented in 
figure ii.1. 
 
figure ii.1 – the positioning of functionalities for managing isolation and security 
mechanisms in inter-cloud 
the data annotation functionalities are built upon elements as follows: 
– data annotation definer: manages the terminology (language) to annotate (or tag) workloads and 
data; 
– data annotation manager : responsible for annotating the workloads and data according to the 
isolation and security requirements; 
– data annota tion handler : responsible for parsing and executing the isolation and security 
requirements based on the annotations of workloads and data.
