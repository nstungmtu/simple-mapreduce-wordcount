10.2.3 multi-tenancy and isolation 
cloud computing  involves the sharing of some resources, and this typically means the sharing of those 
resources with other customers of th e cloud services involved. the terms tenancy and multi-tenancy are 
used to describe the situation where resources are shared. 
a tenant of a cloud service is not quite the same as a cloud service customer  – a tenant is a group of 
csc:cloud service users  sharing access to a set of physical and virtual resources . typically, the group of 
csc:cloud service users will be associated with a particular cloud service customer , but a cloud service 
customer can well have multiple tenants – groups of users from different departments within the customer 
organization, for example. 
multi-tenancy is the allocation of physical or virtual resources  so that multiple tenants and their 
computations and data are isolated from and inaccessible to one another. in other words, the users who 
belong to one tenancy should be completely unaware of the presence of users from another tenancy. 
multi-tenancy does not only affect the cloud services themselves; it also affects the business and 
administration capabilities offered to cloud service customers  by the cloud service provider . information 
about user accounts, subscriptions, usage and billing must all be kept isolated and visible onl y to the 
customers who own the related tenancies. particular care must be taken in relation to resources such as log 
files, which can contain records relating to multiple tenants. if a particular customer needs to access the log 
records, for example when an incident occurs, then the log records must be filtered so that the customer can 
only see records relating to its tenancies.
