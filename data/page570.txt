use case 
description 
 
in this scenario, the daas users access the enterprise applications and data hosted in virtual 
desktops which are created within a daas platform. common applications of this type include 
online word processing, email, communication, co-operating development, etc. the sales staff 
also can view customer information and marketing records on the enterprise website. the 
daas platform interacts with traditional enterprise information and communication 
technology facilities to achieve many control tasks, for instance, using dynamic host 
configuration protocol (dhcp) to assign an ip address for thin client, leveraging internal 
domain name system (dns) server to resolve local host names, and consulting authentication 
of user desktop sessions.
