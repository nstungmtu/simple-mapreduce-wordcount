6.2 naas csc activities 
activities of the naas csc role are described in clause 8.2 of [itu-t y.3502]. these activities are applicable to 
the case of a naas csc involved in a relationship with a naas csp. taking the use cloud service activity  in 
csc-csp relationship (see annex a of [ itu-t y.3502]), figure 6-1 illustrates the relationships between 
functional components involved in the use cloud service activity of the csc:cloud service user sub-role.  
 
figure 6-1 â€“ use of a naas service 
as for any cloud service, naas service capabilities (together with naas administration and business 
capabilities) are positioned in the service layer of the cloud computing layering framework (see clause 9.2 in 
[itu-t y.3502]). 
naas services are made available to the csc:cloud service users via an endpoint and interface enabled by the 
service access functional component. the  csc:cloud service user performs the use cloud service activity 
through the user function functional component, which then invokes naas through the service access 
functional component. the service access functional component performs any authentication of the 
csc:cloud service us er and establishes authorization to use particular naas s ervice capabilities of naas. 
if authorized, the service access functional component invokes the naas service's software implementation 
which then handles the request. 
naas ser vices provide self -service capabilities allowing the naas csc to control, manage, monitor and 
optimize the resources offered as a service by the naas csp in a programmable manner.
