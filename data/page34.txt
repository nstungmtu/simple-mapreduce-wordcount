1 framework and requirements for cloud computing  
 
26  
– interoperability: it is recommended that cloud service provided by the csp  complies with 
appropriate specifications and/or standards for allowing these systems to work together; 
– portability: it is recommended that cloud service provided by the csp supports the portability of 
software assets and the data of cloud service customers (cscs) with minimum disruption; 
– service access: the csp is recommended to provide cscs with access to cloud services from a variety 
of user device s. it is recommended that cs cs be provided with a consistent experience when 
accessing cloud services from different devices; 
– service availability, service reliability and quality assurance : it is recommended that the csp 
provides end-to-end quality of service assurance, high levels of reliability and continued availability 
of cloud services according to the service level agreement (sla) with the csc. 
7 general requirements for iaas 
the general requirements for infrastructure as a service (iaas) derived from the use cases in clause i.2 are as 
follows: 
– configuration, deployment and maintenance  of resources : the ia as csp  is recommended to 
configure, deploy and maintain processing, storage and/or networking resources with specific slas 
and charging models to cscs; 
– use and monitoring of resources: the iaas csp is recommended to provide the capability for cscs 
to use and monitor processing, storage and/or networking resources so that they are able to deploy 
and run arbitrary software. 
note – functional requirements for iaas are provided in [itu-t y.3513]. 
8 general requirements for naas 
the general requirements  for network as a service (naas)  derived from the use cases in clause i.3 are as 
follows: 
– on-demand network configuration : it is required that the naas csp provides the network 
capability, which can be configured on demand by the csc; 
– secure connectivity: it is required that the naas csp provides secure connectivity; 
– qos-guaranteed connectivity : the naas csp is recommended to provide qos -guaranteed 
connectivity according to the negotiated sla; 
– heterogeneous networks compatibility: it is recommended that the  naas csp supports network 
connectivity through heterogeneous networks. 
note – functional requirements for naas are provided in [itu-t y.3512]. 
9 general requirements for daas 
the general requirements  for desktop as a service (daas)  derived from the use cases in clause i.4 are as 
follows: 
– configurability of the virtual environment: it is recommended that a user is capable of configuring 
the virtual desktops' virtual environment, such as the central processing unit (cpu), memory, 
storage, network, etc.; 
– fast boot-up time: daas csp is recommended to provide cscs with appropriate bo ot-up time of 
their virtual desktops; 
– qoe: daas csp is recommended to provide an acceptable user experience, including the running 
speed of application programs and the capability to select and run various applications, when 
application programs run in their csc devices; 
– single sign-on access control: it is recommended that a csc is capable to get all daas functionality 
with appropriate security requirements through a single sign-on mechanism.
