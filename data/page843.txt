reference points of inter-cloud computing  
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
as described in this recommendation, inter-cloud functional architecture reuse the functional components 
of [itu-t y.3502] and extends bss, oss, integration and security system functional components with inter -
cloud functions. given no det ailed interactions and reference points have been defined in [itu -t y.3502] 
between functional components, this appendix provides examples of inter-cloud related reference points for 
informative purposes. 
the reference points of inter-cloud computing architecture are shown in figure ii.1.  
 
figure ii.1 â€“ reference points of inter-cloud computing architecture 
ii.1 reference point: i-ssm-blg 
the subscription management functional component interacts with billing  functional component through 
i-ssm-blg to provide inter-cloud service subscription information for billing. 
ii.2 reference point: i-ssm-ipm 
the subscription management functional component interacts with incident and problem management 
functional component through i -ssm-ipm to synchronize inter -cloud incident- and problem-detecting and 
reporting information. 
ii.3 reference point: i-ssm-mr 
the subscription management functional component interacts with monitoring and reporting functional 
component through i-ssm-mr to get the monitoring information of inter -cloud services of different inter -
cloud service subscriptions. 
ii.4 reference point: i-ssm-sc 
the subscription management functional component interacts with service catalogue functional component 
through i-ssm-sc to synchronize inter-cloud service catalogue information.
