ii.5 hierarchical caching of cloud service images 
table ii.5 – hierarchical caching of cloud service images 
use case 
name hierarchical caching of cloud service images. 
abstract this use case shows an example of hierarchical caching of cloud service images.  
the core cloud mainly manages cloud service images; the size of a cloud service image varies 
from tens of megabytes to hundreds of gigabytes. a cloud service image is needed to run a cloud 
service. for example, when a cloud service is run on the edge cloud, the image is copied from the 
core cloud by request. thus, depending on the num ber of requests, the core cloud can be 
overloaded. in addition, copying a cloud service image from the core cloud to the edge cloud is 
inefficient. 
also, the edge cloud has relatively lower storage capacity than the core cloud or the regional 
cloud. it is inefficient for the edge cloud to maintain all cloud service images.
