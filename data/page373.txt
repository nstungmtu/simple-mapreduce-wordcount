i.1 itu-t references and associated summaries 
[itu-t y.bdpi-mec]  mechanism of deep packet inspection applied in network big data context 
 this proposed recommendation specifies mechanism of dpi for network big 
data. the scope of this proposed recommendation includes: 
– overview of big data processing procedure; 
– analysing role of dpi in big data processing procedure; 
– data classification mechanism used for dpi for big data; 
– data pre-processing mechanism used for dpi for big data; 
– coordination processing mechanism of dpi in network big data context; 
– interfaces between dpi and the upper-layer big data related method.

[itu-t y.bddn-req] requirement of big data-driven networking 
 this proposed recommendation specifies the requirements of bddn. bddn, 
aims at solving the problem where the valuable information from th e 
network can't effectively be used by the network, through making full use of 
big data generated by the network itself; this can provide the data 
intelligence to facilitate network management, operation, control, 
optimization and security, etc. the scope of this work includes: 
– requirements for bddn; 
– requirements of big data plane for bddn; 
– requirements of network plane for bddn; 
– requirements of management plane for bddn; 
– interface requirements for bddn;

[itu-t y.bddn-fr]   framework of big data driven networking based on dpi 
 this proposed recommendation specifies the framework o f data -driven 
networking based on dpi.

[itu-t y.dsf-reqts]  requirements and capabilities for data storage federation 
 this proposed recommendation specifies requirements and capabilities of 
data storage federation which is based on the collection of use cases within 
telecommunication ecosystem, analyses of gaps with different technologies 
and identification of related docu ments in cloud computing and big data 
area. 
 the scope of this proposed recommendation includes: 
– overview of data storage federation; 
– requirements of data storage federation; 
– capabilities of data storage federation; 
– use cases of data storage federation.
