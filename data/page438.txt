figure 8-1 â€“ comprehensive view of cloud computing management 
as shown in figure 8 -1, cloud computing management is realized based on smis, which co rrelate layers 
determined in the reference architecture of cloud comp uting [ itu-t y.3502] to offer complete e2e 
management service chains (see clause 6). 
a management layer represents a level of abstraction within the management system, such that higher layers 
do not need to interact directly with low-level managed elements or components. 
a management component as represented here refers to a collection of management functionality that has 
responsibility for a specific area within a management layer. 
the smis allow elements, components, and layers to expose management inform ation and telemetry in a 
consistent matter that can be rolled up into a comprehensive diagnostics and management service. 
see appendix i for a complex scenario example of the use of this concept. 
the purposes of the management layers are described below. 
8.1.1 customer management layer 
the customer management layer considers the fundamental knowledge of customers' needs and includes all 
functionalities necessary for the acquisition, enhancement and retention of a relationship with a customer. 
for details of the functionalities present in the customer management layer, see clause 10.1. 
8.1.2 product management layer 
the product management layer includes the necessary management functions for maintaining the existing 
product catalogue and providing necessary functions for products sale. 
for details of the functionalities present in the product management layer, see clause 10.2.
