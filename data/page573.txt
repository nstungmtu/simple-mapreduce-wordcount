description 
in this scenario, an application hosted in a daas platform requires input from the local 
resources where a daas client is located, i.e., user terminal, to function properly. for instance, 
an image-based search application will require input from a camera on the terminal; the 
location based application may require gps information from the gps module running on the 
terminal; the schedule planner would require calendar data (meetings, task) from the 
terminal. for instance, alice is using an application called "my locality" which provides a list of 
near-by attractions. this application makes use of gps information, from the gps module 
running in its host, to find the exact current user location. since the application is being used 
remotely and hosted on the network, it needs the user terminal to provide its gps information 
for the application to provide correct results (attractions near the user not near the server 
where the application is hosted). when alice uses the application, local gps data are sent to 
the server where they are used to provide correct results.

description 
 
in this scenario, a consumer is using a particular daas. due to network unavailability, the 
consumer gets disconnected from the daas platform. later on and after network re-
establishment, the consumer starts consuming the service from the same point where it got 
disconnected, enabling preservation of all user data and settings.  
flow: 
• when a disconnected session is noticed, the daas platform identifies the related csc and 
the virtual desktop. 
• the daas platform checks if user has opted for service continuity, i.e., no loss reconnection.  
• the daas platform saves the required data such as virtual machine data before releasing 
the resources. 
• on reconnection, the daas platform shall look for any saved data and reloads them before 
resuming the service.
