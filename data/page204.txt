2 cpu replacement – [b-ocp 2s] provides cpu replacement as 'the motherboard supports all 
intel xeon scalable processor family (aka skylake-sp) processors with tdp 
up to 165w. the motherboard shall provision the support of all future cpus 
in intel xeon scalable processor family platform and the next gen intel xeon  
scalable processor family platform unless noted otherwise' in clause 5.3.1. 
– [b-ocp hsas] provides cpu replacement as 'the motherboard is designed to 
support dual intel xeon e5-2600 v3 and v4 series processors and up to 
2048gb lrdimm 3ds/1024gb lrdimm/ 512gb rdimm ddr4 memory. 
leveraging advanced technology from intel, the motherboard is capable of 
offering scalable 32- and 64-bit computing, high-bandwidth memory design 
and lightning-fast pci-e bus implementation' in clause 7. 
– [b-ocp mb] provides cpu replacement as 'the motherboard uses intel xeon 
e5-2600 v3 (lga2011-3) product family processors with tdp up to 145w. 
the features listed below must be supported by the motherboard: support 
two intel xeon e5-2600 v3 (lga2011-3) product family processors up to 
145w tdp and vendors should engage with intel to ensure the design ready 
for future processors; two full-width intel qpi links up to 9.6 gt/s/direction; 
up to 18 cores per cpu (up to 36 threads with hyper-threading 
technology). up to 45mb last level cache; single processor mode is 
supported' in clause 5.3.1. 
3 multiple cpus – [b-ocp 2s] provides multiple cpus as 'support two intel xeonscalable 
processor family (aka skylake-sp) processors up to 165w tdp and vendors 
should engage with intel to ensure the design ready for future processors' in 
clause 5.3.1. 
– [b- ocp ambh] provides multiple cpus as 'the motherboard supports two 
amd g34 magny cours or interlagos cpus with a tdp (thermal design 
power) of 115w' in clause 4.3. 
– [b- ocp dsbs] provides multiple cpus as 'support up to two processors with 
a thermal design point (tdp) of up to 135 w' in clause 4. 
– [b- ocp dsbs] provides multiple cpus as 'support up to two processors 
using lga2011-3 (socket type r3) and vrd 12.5 and a thermal design point 
(tdp) of up to 145w' in clause 4. 
– [b-ocp hsas] provides multiple cpus as 'the motherboard is designed to 
support dual intel xeon e5-2600 v3 and v4 series processors and up to 
2048gb lrdimm 3ds/1024gb lrdimm/ 512gb rdimm ddr4 memory. 
leveraging advanced technology from intel, the motherboard is capable of 
offering scalable 32- and 64- bit computing, high-bandwidth memory design 
and lightning-fast pci-e bus implementation' in clause 7. 
– [b-ocp imbh] provides multiple cpus as '2 intel xeon e5-2600 (lga2011) 
series processors up to 115w' in clause 4.3. 
– [b-ocp oapm] provides multiple cpus as 'sockets: dual socket operation' in 
clause 5. 
– [b-ocp mb] provides multiple cpus as 'the motherboard uses intel xeon e5-
2600 v3 (lga2011-3) product family processors with tdp up to 145w. the 
features listed below must be supported by the motherboard: support two 
intel xeon e5-2600 v3 (lga2011-3) product family processors up to 145w 
tdp and vendors should engage with intel to ensure the design ready for
