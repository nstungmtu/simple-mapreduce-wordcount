• atis-0200009: the cloud service life cycle checklist establishes a baseline of expectations between 
providers who are interoperating clou d services. the document will also be referenced in cloud 
service standards to provide a reference model for requirements development. each enterprise has 
an existing governance model. the life-cycle checklist provides a way to extend the process model 
between participating companies.

• atis-0200006: this document addresses hosted virtual desktop services for medium and large 
enterprises. it specifies a federation framework to allow service providers to support high -
performance virtual desktops beyond their normal coverage areas. the document also identifies an 
initial set of infrastructure-service interfaces and related requirements. this is a logical basis for the 
work on cloud infrastructure federation.

• atis-0200010: atis standard atis-0200003 provided initial use cases and requirements for content 
distribution network (cdn) interconnection between two cdn providers via cache -based unicast 
delivery method. atis standard atis -0200004 developed use cases and requirements for content 
distribution via multicast -based delivery. this standard, atis -0200005, extends the use cases and 
requirements for an environment involving multiple cdn providers joining together to form a cdn 
federation. the interconnection life -cycle use cases and requirements developed in the prev ious 
two atis standards are re -examined for the impact arising from a federation of multiple cdn 
providers. additional emphasis is placed on the interconnection domain functionality such that 
guidance on the eventual development of network -network interconnect (nni) architectures and 
supporting protocol requirements can be derived.

• atis-0200011: this document extends previous atis w ork on multicast -based content delivery 
methods to mobile end user devices. three use cases describe potential situations where such 
devices can receive multicast -based broadcasts of specific live events/video content via the 3gpp 
evolved multimedia broadc ast multicast system (embms). delivery processes, assumptions, 
content delivery network interconnection implications and supporting requirements are also 
provided.
