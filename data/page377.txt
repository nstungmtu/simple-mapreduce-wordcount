i.3 w3c references and associated summaries 
[w3c dcat]    data catalog vocabulary (dcat) 
 the dcat is an rdf vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability 
between data catalogs published on the web. this document defines the 
schema and provides examples for its use. 
 by using dcat to describe datasets in data cat alogs, publishers increase 
discoverability and enable applications easily to consume metadata from 
multiple catalogs. it further enables decentralized publishing of catalogs and 
facilitates federated dataset search across sites. aggregated dcat metadata 
can serve as a manifest file to facilitate digital preservation.

[w3c ldp 1.0]   linked data platform 1.0 
 ldp defines a set of rules for hypertext transfer protocol (htt p) operations 
on web resources, some based on rdf, to provide an architecture for read -
write linked data on the web.

[w3c mvtd]    metadata vocabulary for tabular data 
 validation, conversion, display, an d search of tabular data on the web 
requires additional metadata that describes how the data should be 
interpreted. this document defines a vocabulary for metadata that 
annotates tabular data. this can be used to provide metadata at various 
levels, from gr oups of tables and how they relate to each other down to 
individual cells within a table.

[w3c mtdm]   model for tabular data and metadata on the web 
 this document outlines a data model, or infoset, for tabular data and 
metadata about that tabular data that can be used as a basis for validation, 
display, or creating other formats. it also contains some non -normative 
guidance for publishing tabular data as cs v and how that maps into the 
tabular data model.
