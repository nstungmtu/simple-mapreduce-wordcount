i.11 the use case for data storage federation management 
title the use case for data storage federation management 
description the management is generally separate from the data path and the management control path 
and management is driven through the provisioning and policy management. the management 
provides the ability to display, create, modify and delete the contents of on -premises and public 
cloud services integrated into a single storage.  
in backend storage management, the storage configuration is different from the on -premises 
and the public cloud storage service. the interfaces for backend storage are made in the form of 
the separate software daemon. when there are multiple cloud storage devices, dsf local 
storage management can be configured and a proxy interface can be configured to interface 
with them and an interface for registering and using on-premises storage is provided.
