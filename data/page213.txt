relationship with related specifications from other sdos 
23 interface for 
controlling fan speed 
– [b-ocp 2s] requires vendors to enable fan speed control (fsc) on bmc. the 
fsc algorithm processes sensor data and drives two pwm outputs to 
optimized speed, in clause 9.12. 
– [b-ocp ambh] requires odm to provide system access interface to retrieve 
hardware sensor readings and control fan speed, in clause 6. 
– [b-ocp dsbs] describes how decathlete server board shall support acpi to 
control power and fan speed in clause 8.2. 
– [b-ocp sfci] describes how server management controller like bmc use 
standard ipmi commands to manage sfc in whole document. 
– [b-ocp ocsps] describes that the psu shall adjust internal fan speed based 
upon internal temperature sensor(s) in clause 4.3. 
– [b-ocp tp] requires vendors to enable fsc on the bmc in clause  8.12. 
24 monitoring status of 
physical machine 
– [b-ocp 1s] provides monitoring status set as 'there is also a blinking amber 
heartbeat led on the twin lakes 1s server to indicate that the bridge ic is in 
operating mode' in clause 9.8. 
– [b-ocp 2s] provides system state monitor set as 'there are 4 states of 
power/system identification led depending on system power state and 
chassis identify status' in clause 9.6. 
– [b-ocp yose] provides monitor status set as 'on the adapter card of a 
yosemite v2 sled, there is a power button, a reset button, an ocp debug 
card and a usb port attached to the current selected 1s server. there are 
four blue leds placed on the baseboard in the same order as 1s server slots 
to indicate server status' in clause 9.4. 
– [b-ocp o1usm] provides visual indication set as 'a 3d mechanical drawing 
of the front panel is shown in figure 2. the front panel supports the 
following mechanical features. status leds o uid, attention, power status' 
in clause 4.1. 
25 visual indications – [b-ocp jbog] provides system event log (sel) set as 'the bmc needs to 
support sel capabilities. the following items are to be logged in the sel' in 
clause 7.1.  
– [b-ocp sj] provides silk screen colour set as 'the colour of silk screen is 
white and the labels for the components are listed as below' in clause 13.4. 
– [b-ocp yose] provides visual feedback set as 'the led associated with the 
active 1s server blinks as visual feedback to the user. when a bmc is 
selected, all four leds blink as visual feedback to the user' in clause 9.4.1.  
– [b-ocp oapm] provides visual indication set as 'the motherboard supports 
a blue uid (unit id) led used to help visually locate a specific server within a 
data centre' in clause 6.11.1. 
26 equipment for 
mounting and removal 
– [b-ocp 1s] provides easy to remove set as 'the air baffle must be easy to 
service with the goal of requiring no tooling to remove' in clause 6.6.  
– [b-ocp 2s] provides removal set as 'it is installed on a sheet metal panel 
with tool-less install and removal' in clause 12.2.5. 
– [b-ocp imbh] provides mounting and removal set as 'in order to remove 
and install one board without affecting the other board, the following 
internal connectors are placed as close as possible to front of the board in 
order to have easy frontal access' in clause 4.2 and "the pcie* x4 connector 
can be hot inserted and removed" in clause 10.2.
