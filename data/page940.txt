in itu-t, study group 17 (sg 17) has been designated the lead study group for "telecommunication security" 
which includes developing and maintaining security outreach material; coordination of security-related work; 
and identification of needs and assignment and prioritization of work to encourage timely development of 
telecommunication security recommendations.  
6 potential interoperability testing areas of cloud computing 
cloud computing involves a wide variety of technologies, from distributed processing to virtualization. the 
types of capabilities offered are also diverse: from iaas, in which the cloud capabilities type provided to the 
csc is an infrastructure capabilities type, and paas, in which the cloud capabilities type provided to the csc 
is a platform capabilities type, to saas, in which the cloud capabilities type provided to the csc is an 
application capabilities type. 
the targets of cloud computing standardizatio n are so diverse that many standards organizations are 
studying cloud computing focusing on their respective areas of expertise. taking into consideration the 
targets of interoperability testing in clause 5, it is possible to identify the targets for interoperability testing 
as the follows: 
• target area a: interaction between csc and csp (between user layer and access layer); 
• target area b: collaboration among different cloud services (between service layers including inter-
cloud); 
• target area c: consi stent and interoperable of manage interface (between multi-layer functions 
(e.g., bss/oss) and cloud services); 
• target area d: collaboration with legacy network. 
note – collaboration with legacy network is not defined in [itu-t y.3502]. target area d is not illustrated in figure 6-1.
