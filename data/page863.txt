table i.4 – sso authentication within inter-cloud environment 
figure 
(optional) 
 
pre-
conditions 
(optional) 
– the csps(saas) form a federation pattern of inter-cloud. 
– the csps(saas) use a third-party sso system for implementing sso authentication functionality 
within their federation. 
post-
conditions 
(optional) 
– the csc is able to access various services offered by different csps once it is successfully 
authenticated by any member of the csps(saas) federation. 
derived 
requirements 
– sso authentication (refer to clause 7.4). 
– periodical verification (refer to clause 7.5). 
i.5 use case of control privilege of inter-cloud 
this use case illustrates security and control concerns in inter-cloud. the peering pattern of inter-cloud used 
to illustrate the use case is an example only. 
 
table i.5 – control privilege of inter-cloud 
title control privilege of inter-cloud 
description – the csc requests saas service from csps(saas); 
– both csp1(saas) and csp2(saas) use infrastructure including computing and storage 
resources from csp (infrastructure as a service (iaas)) to provide their cloud services. 
therefore, they all have service instances and data in csp(iaas); 
– for the sake of csps(saas) data security and privacy, csp(iaas) control over the 
infrastructure should be limited to avoid inspection or analysis of csps(saas) data and 
vm instances without explicit csps(saas) consent; 
– csps(saas) should be able to exercise fine-grained control over protection of their 
cloud resources according to a given security sla. this means that csps(saas) should 
be able to actively monitor their allocated resources; 
– csps(saas) should not be authorized to monitor or modify vm state, service data and 
csc data from other cscs. 
roles cscs, csps(saas), csp(iaas).
