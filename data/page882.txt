appendix i 
 
cloud interoperability testing scenarios 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
itu-t, etsi and nist have been considering wide technical areas related to cloud computing and also 
developing several use case documents which are generally recognised by cloud computing industry. since 
the use case documents are like a framework document for cloud usage and involve wide technical areas, 
the documents shown below are useful reference documents in order to develop  cloud interoperability 
testing specifications.  
1) itu-t y.3500 series   
[itu-t y.3501] – cloud computing framework and high-level requirements  
appendix i – use cases of cloud computing 
 [itu-t y.3511] – framework of inter-cloud computing for network and infrastructure    
appendix i – use cases from the inter-cloud perspective 
appendix ii – use cases from telecom and non-telecom providers' views 
appendix iii – abstract service offering models for inter-cloud computing 
2) etsi cloud standards coordination final report (november 2013) 
section 3 – use cases analysis (especially cloud bursting) 
3) nist cloud computing program technical efforts  
nist cloud computing test scenario use cases – version 1 
4) odca usage model for iaas, paas, saas 
 odca has published many usage models:  
 odca saas_interop_um_rev1.0 software as service (saas) interoperability 
 odca paas_interop_um_rev1.0 platform as a service (paas) interoperability 
 odca vm_interoperability_in_a hybrid_cloud_enviroment_rev1.2 virtual machine (vm) 
interoperability in a hybrid cloud environment 
 odca vm_interop_poc_white_paper implementing the open data center alliance virtual 
machine interoperability usage model
