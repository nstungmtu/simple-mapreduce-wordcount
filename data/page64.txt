1 framework and requirements for cloud computing  
 
56  
• application capabilities type;  
• platform capabilities type;  
• infrastructure capabilities type. 
cloud capabilities types and cloud service categories are covered in rec. itu-t y.3500 | iso/iec 17788. 
cloud services are also grouped into categories, where each category is a group of cloud services that possess 
a common set of qualities. the services in these categories can include capabilities from one or more of the 
cloud capabilities types above. 
representative cloud service categories include: 
• infrastructure as a service (iaas); 
• platform as a service (paas); 
• software as a service (saas); 
• network as a service (naas). 
other cloud service categories are described in rec. itu-t y.3500 | iso/iec 17788. 
7.2.5 cloud deployment models 
cloud deployment models are covered in rec. itu-t y.3500 | iso/iec 17788. this clause provides a summary. 
cloud deployment models are a way in which cloud computing can be organized based on the control and 
sharing of physical or virtual resources. 
the cloud deployment models include: 
• public cloud; 
• private cloud; 
• community cloud; 
• hybrid cloud. 
7.2.6 cross-cutting aspects 
cross-cutting aspects  are behaviours or capabilities which need to be coordinated across roles and 
implemented consistently in a cloud computing system.  
cross-cutting aspects can be shared and can impact multiple roles, cloud computing activities and functional 
components. 
cross-cutting aspects apply to multiple individual roles or functional components. 
an example of a cross-cutting aspect is security. 
a description of the cross-cutting aspects is provided in clause 8.5. 
7.3 functional view of cloud computing 
the functional view is a technology -neutral view of the functions necessary to form a cloud computing 
system. the functional view describes the distribution of function s necessary for the support of cloud 
computing activities. 
the functional architecture also defines the dependencies between functions. 
the functional view addresses the following cloud computing concepts: 
• functional components;  
• functional layers; and 
• multi-layer functions.
