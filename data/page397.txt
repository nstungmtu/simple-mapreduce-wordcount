• itu-t y.3513 : this recommendation provides the functional requirements and use cases  of 
infrastructure as a service ( iaas), one of the representative cloud service categories. this 
recommendation covers the following: 
– general description of iaas;  
– functional requirements of iaas; 
– typical iaas use cases.

• itu-t y.3515 : this recommendation specifies naas functional architecture, including 
functionalities, functional components as well as reference points and procedures, based on the 
functional requirements specified in [itu-t y.3512]. the scope of this recommendation consists of: 
– overview of naas functional architecture; 
– functionalities of naas; 
– functional components of naas; 
– reference points between functional components of naas; 
– procedures for typical naas use cases.

• itu-t y. 3516: this recommendation specifies inter -cloud computing functional architecture, 
including functions and fun ctional components, based on the inter -cloud computing framework 
specified in [itu -t y.3511]. the recommendation builds upon the functional view of the cloud 
computing reference architecture [itu -t y.3502] and makes extensions to functional components 
with inter-cloud functions. this recommendation also describes the mapping between functions 
and functional requirements of inter -cloud computing and examples of inter -cloud related 
reference points.

• itu-t y.3519 : this recommendation provides an overview of the big data as a service (bdaas) 
functional architecture and defines the bdaas functional architecture and its cross-cutting aspects 
by specifying the functional components for the support of bdaas.

• itu-t y.dsf -arch: this recommendation describes the functional architecture for data storage 
federation (dsf). the dsf functions based on dsf logical components identified in y.35xx (ex y.dsf-
reqts) are introduced. the dsf functional architecture, including dsf functions and dsf  functional 
components, is specified. this recommendation also provides the relationship between the dsf 
functional architecture and the cloud computing reference architecture.
