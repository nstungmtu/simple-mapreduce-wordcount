6.2 benefits of data storage federation 
dsf provides not only a single virtual volume federated from dsf local storage, but also from a customer 
perspective beneficial features such as cost, technical function, service enhancement and resource 
utilization. beneficial features include:  
– easy storage management: simplified management by using a single user interface and centralized 
monitoring. 
– cost-effectiveness: reduction of storage usage costs by moving rarely used customer data to a 
cheaper dsf local storage. 
– performance enhancement : improvement of data access performance by storing data to high -
speed storages such as solid state disk (ssd), main memory, etc. 
– data reliability: increased reliability by replicating the data storing to another dsf local storage. 
– storage scalability: support of on-demand storage capacity by scaling storage resources. 
– storage utilization efficiency : increased of storage capacity by combining two or more dsf local 
storages to store a large sized file. 
– data security: stores secure data by splitting importan t files into multiple fragments and storing 
them on different dsf local storages. 
– data management transparency : convenient data management for data discovery, use of data 
without knowledge of data location, storage type and data format. 
6.3 configuration of logical components for data storage federation 
figure 6 -3 shows the general configuration environment for logical components of dsf. the logical 
components consist of customer, storage connection, data manipulation, data distribution and storage, dsf 
local storage management, provision and policy management and dsf local storage including cloud and on-
premises storage.
