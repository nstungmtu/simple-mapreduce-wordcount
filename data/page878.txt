7 cloud computing interoperability testing between csp and csp 
ideally, multiple interoperable csps could interact in different patterns of inter-cloud: peering, federation, 
and intermediary patterns, as defined in [itu-t y.3511]. in inter-cloud peering pattern, two csps interwork 
directly with each other, and one csp can use the services provided by the peer csp. in inter-cloud 
federation pattern, a group of peer csps mutually combine their service capabilities in order to provide 
the set of cloud services required by cscs. in inter-cloud intermediary pattern, csp interworks with one 
or more peer csps and provides intermediation, aggregation and arbitrage of services provided by these 
csps. 
the functions which should be tested for inter cloud computing interoperability need to be prescribed 
according to the functional requirements described in [itu -t y.3511]. the following bullet items indicate  
aspects to be considered in the cloud computing interoperability testing of the csp-csp interworking. 
• sla and policy negotiation should be confirmed as follows: 
– the sla and policy information that is aware of the sla information related to the qos and  
performance aspects of the csps involved is exchanged among multiple csps using standard 
formats; 
– the sla and policy information comparing, negotiating and settling down service provisioning 
policies is exchanged among multiple csps using standard formats.
