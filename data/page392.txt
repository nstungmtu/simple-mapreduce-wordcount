the vertical axis describes the sub - or related technology. the horizontal axis describes the document 
category which covers the following applicable subjects: 
– general, definition: the standard which provides a general description or terms and definitions of  
the technology; 
– requirements, use cases: the standard which provides use cases and derived general/functional 
requirements; 
– architecture: the standard which provides reference architecture; 
– api, interface, profile: the standard which provides a common interface, api and/or its profile; 
– data model, format, schema: the standard which provides a data model or protocol including 
scheme and/or its encoding format; 
– others (e.g., guidelines, technical reports, etc.). 
note 1 – the items on the horizontal axis are not subordinate to the different technologies.  
note 2 – the items of vertical axis can be modified with technology changes. 
note 3 – a standard has more than one location on a matrix. if a standard includes multiple document (horizontal axis) 
categories or related technologies (vertical axis), it should be mapped multiple times.
