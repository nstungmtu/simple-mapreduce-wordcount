7.4 client support 
client support function: 
– establishes a connection for a virtual desktop on the client side (see clause 7.4.1 service connection 
function); 
– supports the optimized user interaction on a daas client (see clause 7.4.2 connection negotiation 
function); 
– handles peripherals on a daas client (see clause 7.4.3 client peripheral connection function); 
– guarantees that the virtual desktop service remains turned  on (see clause 7.4.4 service continuity 
for user environment). 
7.4.1 service connection 
the service connection function supports a daas client to establish a connection for virtual desktop service. 
this function: 
– transmits csu's access information to the user access management function (see clause 7.2.3) to 
verify a daas user; 
– exchanges virtual desktop access information with the client connection management function (see 
clause 7.2.2) after user authentication; 
– supports various types of daas clients such as personal computer, laptop computer, tablet 
computer, and thin client to access a virtual desktop; 
– periodically sends the connection state of the daas client to the client connection management 
function (see clause 7.2.2) to monitor the client state for the preservation of the client connection. 
in case of a temporarily unavailable  connection, the daas client notifies the connection state to a 
daas user; 
– transmits the daas user's requests (i.e., additional resource, resources cancelling,  and additional 
virtual desktop service) to the client connection management function (see clause 7.2.2); 
– maintains a standard security connection to protect the content exchanged between a daas client 
and a daas platform. 
7.4.2 connection negotiation 
the connection negotiation function considers two main factors for daas : network performance 
(e.g., network bandwidth or traffic information) between a daas client and a daas platform; and the client 
state of a daas client. based on these two main factors, it supports the optimized user interaction on the 
daas client. 
the connection negotiation function: 
– gathers network performance information and the client state, and transmits them to a daas 
platform through a network; 
 note 1 – the client state consists  of static and dynamic information of a daas client such as specification  of 
display, usage and specification of hardware resources ( i.e., cpu, gpu, and memory) , and user interaction 
methods supported on a daas client. 
 note 2 – the static information is collected at the initial connection  between a daas client and a daas 
platform after user verification. the dynamic information is collected periodically when the client is connected 
to the daas platform to use a virtual desktop service. 
– allows a daas client to display with best-efforts resolution for client without delay; 
– receives the negotiation results from a daas platform after the completion of a negotiation; 
– reflects the negotiation results in a daas client.
