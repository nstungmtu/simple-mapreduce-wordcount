• itu-t x.1601: this recommendation provides guidelines for cloud service customer data security in 
cloud computing, for those cases where the cloud service provider (csp) is responsible for ensuring 
that the data is handled with proper security. this is not always the case, s ince for some cloud 
services the security of the data will be the responsibility of the cloud service customers (cscs) 
themselves. in other cases, the responsibility may be mixed. 
 for example, in some cases the csp may be responsible for restricting access to the data, while the 
csc remains responsible for deciding which cloud service users (csus) should have access to it, and 
the behaviour of any scripts or applications with which the csu processes the data. 
 this recommendation identifies security controls for cloud service customer data that can be used 
in different stages of the full data life cycle. these security controls may differ when the security 
level of the cloud service customer data changes. therefore, the recommendation provides 
guidelines on when each control should be used for best security practice.

• itu-t x.1631 | iso/iec 27017: recommendation itu-t x.1631 | iso/iec 27017 provides guidelines 
for information security controls applicable to the provision and use of cloud services by providing: 
– additional implementation guidance for relevant controls specified in iso/iec 27002; 
– additional controls with implementation guidance that specifically relate to cloud services. 
 this recommendation | international standard provides controls and implementation guidance for 
both cloud service providers and cloud service customers.

• itu-t x.1642: this recommendation provides guideline of operational security for cloud computing, 
which includes guidance on service level agreements (slas) and daily security maintenance for cloud 
computing. the target audiences of this recommendation are cloud service providers, such as 
traditional telecommunication operators, isps and icps.

• itu-t x.1602: this recommendation provides a generic functional description for a secure service 
oriented software as a service (saas) application environment that is independent of network types, 
operating systems, middleware, vendor specific products or solutions. in addition, this
