 framework and requirements for cloud computing 1 
 
   333 
– analysis algorithm adaptation, which offers the capabilities to apply algorithms of classifica tion, 
regression, clustering, association rules, ranking, etc. to process the datasets according to the csc 
demands; 
– distributed processing, which offers the capabilities to distribute the processing tasks to a cluster of 
computing nodes; 
– data application, which offers the capabilities to support applications or application plug-ins to use 
the analysis results of datasets. 
9.5 data visualization capabilities 
data visualization capabilities include: 
– data visualization, which offers the capabilities to create, configure, deliver and customize the visual 
representation of data analysis results. 
– data reporting, which offers the capabilities to make reports of summary, key elements and analysis 
results of datasets. 
9.6 data management capabilities 
data management capabilities include: 
– data provenance, which offers the capabilities to manage information pertaining to any source of 
data including the party or parties involved in generation and introduction processes for data; 
– data preservation, which off ers the capabilities to manage the series of activities necessary to 
ensure continued access to data according to relevant policy; 
– data ownership, which offers the capabilities to manage property rights of data possession and 
disposition according to the change of data status (e.g., after data integration); 
– processes monitoring, which offers the information related to data processing; 
 note – this capability can include information such as the success of the job and task, running time, resource 
utilization, etc. 
– metadata management, which offers the capabilities of creating, defining, attributing, controlling 
and updating metadata information. 
9.7 data security and protection capabilities 
data security and protection capabilities include: 
– access control, which offers the capabilities to manage the rights of parties to control or influence 
the information related to them; 
– policy control, which offers the capabilities to control policies of data protection and security; 
– data security, which offers the capabilities to apply the storage, network and service related security 
mechanisms, including administrative, operational and maintenance issues. 
10 security considerations 
security aspects for consideration within cloud computing environments, including cloud infrastructure, iaas, 
naas, daas  are addressed by security challenges for csps, as described in [itu -t x.1601].  in particular, 
[itu-t x.1601] analyses security threats and challenges, and  describes security capabilities that could 
mitigate these threats and meet security challenges. 
relevant security requirements of [b-itu-t y.2201], [b-itu-t y.2701] and applicable x, y and m series of itu-t 
recommendations need to be taken into considerat ion, including access control, authentication, data 
confidentiality, data retention policy, network security, data integrity, availability and privacy.
