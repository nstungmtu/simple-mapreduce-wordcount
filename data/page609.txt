relationship between daas logical components and cloud  
computing reference architecture 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this appendix provide s the relationship between daas logical compo nents [itu-t y.3503] and cloud 
computing reference architecture in [itu-t y.3502]. 
the relationship between daas logical components and cloud computing reference architecture can be done 
in two steps. 
the first step is the mapping between daas logical comp onents and daas functions in clause 6.  based on 
clause 6, each corresponding functions of daas for the daas logical components in [itu-t y.3503] is described 
in table 6-1. 
the second step is the mapping between daas functions and f unctional components of c loud computing 
reference architecture. this mapping is described in figure 8-1. 
therefore, the possible mapping between daas  logical components and functional components in cloud 
computing reference architecture is shown in figure i.1.
