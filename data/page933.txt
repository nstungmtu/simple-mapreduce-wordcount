5.1.10 odca 
the odca is an independent organization created in oct ober 2010 with the assistance of intel corporation 
to coordinate the development of standards for cloud computing. the organization has created a usage 
model roadmap featuring 19 prioritized usage models. the usage models provide detailed requirements for 
data centre and cloud solutions, and will include detailed technical documentation discussing the 
requirements for technology deployments. 
four cci related usage models have been published by odca, while odca also initiated a new poc project 
to determine where the virtual machine (vm) industry currently is in meeting interoperability requirements 
outlined in the odca vm interoperability usage model in 2013.

a team led by t -systems telekom innovation laboratories, the fzi research te am from the university of 
karlsruhe and supported by intel corporation carried out a poc project to implement the usages described 
in the document: implementing the odca virtual machine interoperability usage model. 
the implementing the odca virtual machine interoperability usage model poc was developed within the 
odca manageability and services workgroup and includes specifications for interoperability developed by 
dmtf, an odca partner organization.
