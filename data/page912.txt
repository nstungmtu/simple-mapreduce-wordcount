ii.3.7 test case: load balance 
table ii.28 shows the test case for load balance. 
table ii.28 – test case: load balance 
load balance test description 
test purpose to verify that the csc deploys a load balance mechanism for multiple vms in order to 
achieve scalability and fault tolerance of an application. 
reference [itu-t y.3513] clause 7.3.6 
test sequence step type description result 
1 stimulus the csc configures a round-robin based load balance for 
http traffic among vms. 
 
2 check the http request is forwarded to each server in turn based 
on a round-robin load balancing policy in step 1. 
 
3 stimulus the csc configures a least-connection scheduling based load 
balance for ftp traffic among vms. 
 
4 check the ftp workload is balanced by assigning a new connection 
request to the vm with the smallest number of connections 
based on a least-connection scheduling load balancing policy 
in step 3.  
 
test verdict it is deemed as successfully terminated if all the checks are successful, otherwise it is 
deemed as failed. 
 
ii.3.8 test case: firewall 
table ii.29 shows the test case for firewall. 
table ii.29 – test case: firewall 
firewall test description 
test purpose to verify that the csc monitors and controls incoming and outgoing vm traffic based on 
predetermined security rules. 
reference [itu-t y.3513] clause 7.3.7 
test sequence step type description result 
 1 stimulus the csc configures the vm's network policies to reject all 
incoming traffic.  
 
2 check the vm's incoming traffic is dropped by the firewall.  
3 stimulus the csc configures the vm's network policy to reject all 
outgoing traffic. 
 
4 check the vm's outgoing traffic is dropped by the firework.  
test verdict it is deemed as successfully terminated if all the checks are successful, otherwise it is 
deemed as failed.
