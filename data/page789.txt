(13) the scu transfers the media address to the csau. 
(14) after receiving the real-time media address, the csau requests the mdu to start transmitting the 
media stream. 
(15) the mdu sends a request to the pu for initiating a media stream. 
(16) the pu creates a media channel with the mdu and sends the media stream to the mdu. 
(17) the mdu transfers the media stream to the csau. 
(18) the csau transfers this media stream to the csdu to store it in the cloud data nodes. 
(19) when the storage plan is completed, the cu sends a stop-media request to the csau. 
(20) the csau transfers this stop request to the mdu. 
(21) the mdu returns a response to the csau. 
(22) the csau requests the scu to disconnect. 
(23) the scu returns a response to end this real-time media storage.
