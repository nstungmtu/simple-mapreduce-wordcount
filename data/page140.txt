title the data read/write cache and parallel distributed file  
for performance enhancement 
description dsf service provider provides a cache function for data stored in a public cloud storage. data 
stored in public cloud storage is slower than on-premises storage because data is transmitted 
over the internet. in addition, since the data is automatically distributed to the public cloud 
storage in the state dsf service customer does not recognize, the data stored in the public 
cloud storage needs a high-speed access function. dsf service provider caches the data stored 
in the public cloud storage to the storage device inside the cloud integrated storage operating 
platform to provide an on-premises storage-level access speed to the public cloud storage.
