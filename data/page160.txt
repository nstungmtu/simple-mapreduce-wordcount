1 framework and requirements for cloud computing  
 
152  
– history of cloud service co ntrol status validation : it is recommended that a csn: cloud service 
broker manage history of validation results as well as required time for completing cloud service 
controls. 
– notification of result for request of cloud service control : it is recommende d that a csn: cloud 
service broker provide notification of the result of cloud service control to a csc. 
– detection of failures to meet the terms of the sla : it is required that a csn: cloud service broker 
detect failures to meet the terms of the sla through monitoring and to verify the service level. 
 note 8 – to detect failures to meet the terms of the sla, monitoring includes one or more measurable 
information such as storage speeds, memory capacity and performance, computing speeds, network speeds, 
service response time, etc. 
 note 9 – if a failure to meet the terms of the sla is found in the integrated cloud service, a csn: cloud service 
broker identifies the cloud service that caused the failure. 
– prevention of service termination during m igration: it is recommended that a csn: cloud service 
broker provide postponing of the termination of a running cloud service until the csn: cloud service 
broker verifies ready status of a new service to prevent loss of data during migration process. 
8 security considerations  
security aspects for consideration within the cloud computing environment, are addressed by security 
challenges for the csps as described in [itu-t x.1601]. in particular, [itu-t x.1601] analyses security threats 
and challenges and de scribes security capabilities that could mitigate these threats and meet the security 
challenges.
