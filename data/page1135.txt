automation of many components was also mentioned among bottlenecks that need to be addressed for an 
effective deployment of cloud services as perceived by cloud customers. 
4.4 what are the scenarios that can spur the adoption of cloud services in the country and in 
developing countries? 
received responses are the following: 
• electricity supply, broadband connectivity, security and privacy issues 
• access to finances for csps, more capacity building and training for end users 
• white labelled solutions 
• bandwidth cost 
• cloudification of infrastructures is not a matter of choice any more 
• government support and regulation, capacity and skilled manpower 
• providing cloud services by telcos may increase the adoption of these services in the developing 
countries because telcos are trusted parties in these countries 
• economies of scale (shared resources, cost savings, cost reduction) 
• centralised government services 
• local data centres for sme's 
• website hosting locally 
• cloud computing awareness workshops 
• developing countries are providing cloud services by telecom companies, but we do not have it by 
telecom company
