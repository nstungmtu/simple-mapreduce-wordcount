figure 6-2 – relationship between user view and functional view 
in terms of user view, 4 sub-roles and 12 activities are defined in [itu-t y.3600]. these activities in the user 
view are supported by  functional components in the functional view. clause 7 identifies the functional 
components needed for support of the activities and of the requirements defined in [itu-t y.3600]. 
note – appendix i provides the mapping between requirements, activities and functional components.  
7 functional architecture for bdaas 
this clause defines the functional architecture for support of the bdaas cloud service category. the functional 
architecture is identified on the basis of the analysis of requirements and capabilities of cloud computing 
based big data described in [itu-t y.3600]. 
according to the cloud computing layering fr amework [itu-t y.3502], the functions in the cloud computing 
functional architecture are d ivided into four layers and a division called multi -layer functions, which spans 
across the four layers. 
following the methodology of [ itu-t y.3502], the bdaas functional architecture is described from a set of 
functional components. the functional components consist of sets of functions that are required to perform 
bdaas activities for the roles and sub-roles described in [itu-t y.3600]. 
figure 7-1 shows the functional architecture for bdaas. the bdaas architecture is defined by leveraging cloud 
computing reference architecture (ccra) ([itu-t y.3502]) with: 
– extensions to the existing functional components; 
– adding new functional component.
