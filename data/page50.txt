use case 
pre-conditions 
(optional) 
– ① a csp builds a cloud infrastructure with cloud resources including compute, storage and 
network resources. 
– ②,③ the csp allocates and configures related compute, storage and network resources in 
the cloud infrastructure needed for deploying any kind of cloud services through resource 
orchestration functions. 
– ④ the csp publishes the deployed cloud services in the catalogue of the cloud service 
portal. 
– ⑤ a csc accesses the cloud services published by the csp through service portals or 
service interfaces which are protected by appropriate security mechanisms.  
– ⑥ related cloud resources and capabilities have been invoked to respond to the csc's 
access and interaction. 
post-conditions – ⑦ the csp manages and monitors pooled compute, storage and network resources in the 
cloud infrastructure. 
requirements – resource provisioning 
– resource abstraction and control 
i.11 trusted cloud service use case 
use case 
name trusted cloud service use case 
abstract the csp provides trusted cloud service which satisfies a set of requirements and 
transparency for governance, management and security to provide csc confidence in using 
the cloud service.

pre-conditions 
(optional) 
– the csc requests a trusted cloud service: 
• the csp1 offers the same cloud services as csp2, but csp2 does not meet trusted 
cloud service requirements. 
• the csc gets effective cloud service information from csp1. 
• the csc does not have effective cloud service information from csp2.  
– the csp1 negotiates a cloud service agreement with the csc before providing a cloud 
service, while csp2 does not.
