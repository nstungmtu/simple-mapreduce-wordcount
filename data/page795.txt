figure 7-7 shows the procedural flows of the media acquisition from the cloud storage system to the cu: 
(1) the cu initiates a media acquisition request and sends this request to the scu. 
(2) the scu forwards this acquisition request to the cmu. 
(3) the cmu authenticates the acquisition access permission and then sends this request to the csmu. 
(4) the csmu authenticates the acquisition access permission and then sends this request to the csau. 
(5) the csau returns a response to the csmu when it is ready for this media acquisition request. 
(6) the csmu returns the csau information to the cmu. 
(7) the cmu sends a response to the scu. 
(8) the scu forwards this response to the cu. 
(9) when the cu receives the response, it sends a media acquisition request to the csau. 
(10) the csau transfers this request to the csdu. 
(11) after receiving this request, the  csdu creates a media channel with the csau to transmit the 
required media data. 
(12) the csau transfers the media data to the cu. 
(13) when the cu stops the media acquisition, it sends a stop request to the csau. 
(14) the csau transfers this request to the csdu. 
(15) the csdu returns a response to the csau. 
(16) the csau requests the scu to disconnect. 
(17) the scu returns a response to end this media acquisition operation.
