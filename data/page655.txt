– it is recommended that iaas csp provides operations handling mechanisms related to machine 
templates, such as upload, update, disable, enable, query and delete to the csc. 
7.2  storage service functional requirements 
– it is recommended that iaas csp provides storage functions, such as block  level storage, file level 
storage and object-based storage, with specific slas and charg ing model to the csc. the sto rage 
functions can be provided to the csc directly or used by the virtual machine as attached storage. 
– it is recommended that iaas csp provides the csc with operations handling mechanisms related to 
storage, such as create, attach, detach, query and dele te a volume of storage at either block level 
or file-system level, write, read and delete data for a given storage.
