table ii.5 – physical machine for hyper-scale deployment – use case 
derived 
requirements 
– minimum energy consumption (see clause 7.1.2) 
– no additional ports (see clause 7.5) 
– authorized access (see clause 7.5) 
– hot-plug support (see clause 7.6) 
– visual indications (see clause 7.1.4) 
 
table ii.6 – physical machine for unmanned deployment – use case 
title physical machine for unmanned deployment 
description this use case covers the situation where physical machines will be in places where physical 
access is extremely difficult or only available at infrequent intervals. in this case, a single 
physical machine will typically be implemented as a server blade that fits into a specially built 
rack. the rack will typically also include storage, management and networking equi pment, 
which might or might not be implemented using similar blades. 
roles/sub-roles csp: cloud service operations manager. 
figure in this type of deployment, physical machines 
are constructed for deployment in locations 
where physical access is very tightly 
constrained. these will typically be inside some 
form of self-contained "capsule" rather than a 
normal building. 
examples are systems deployed in underwater 
containers for positioning close to coastal 
urban centres. 
pre-conditions 
(optional) 
csp: the csp wishes to deploy physical machines in locations where human access will not be 
possible for the majority or operational time. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
the physical machines are left running without human access for periods of six months or 
more. 
the data centre management system can deploy workloads to the machine. in the event of 
failure, the machine can be taken off line, remote diagnostics can be run and the machine 
either returned to service or taken permanently offline. 
derived 
requirements 
– minimum energy consumption (see clause 7.1.2) 
– cooling component replacement (see clause 7.1.3) 
– cooling component redundancy (see clause 7.1.3) 
– interface for controlling fan speed (see clause 7.1.3) 
– self-checking mechanism (see clause 7.1.6) 
– remote management (see clause 7.3) 
– diagnostic of physical machine (see clause 7.3)
