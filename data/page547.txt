figure (optional) 
 
pre-conditions (optional) the csps (saas) form an inter-cloud federation pattern. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
 
derived requirements merging technologies for encrypted data (see clause 9.4) 
integrated key management (see clause 9.4) 
i.6 use case of data policy language 
this use case illustrates inter-cloud data annotation, processing and usage aspects between csc and csp or 
between csps. the inter-cloud federation pattern used to illustrate the use case is an example only. 
table i.6 – data policy language 
title data policy language 
description a csp (naas) offers access to internet (service) over virtual home gateway (vhgw) 
facilities using network functions virtualization (nfv) and software-defined networking 
(sdn) technologies. the csp (naas) forms an inter-cloud federation pattern with a 
group of peer csps [here csps (paas) and csp (saas)] to optimize its own resources and 
leverage area of service availability. the csp (naas) uses a data policy language to 
annotate, process and use vhgw data in the inter-cloud environment. 
the csp (naas) monitors service (here access to internet) to ensure that particular key 
performance indicators (kpis) are respected (e.g., energy efficiency, resource 
optimization, performance). in the case of a given kpi cross threshold, the service (here 
access to internet) is automatically reallocated among members of the federation that 
respect data policy determined by the csp (naas).
