10.5 reliable electricity 
electricity is one of the main challenges for the provision of cloud computing services.  
to benefit from cloud computing services, developing countries have to resolve the problems of 
inaccessibility, unaffordability and poor quality of electricity. 
10.6 data centres 
it is generally recommended that data centres should be of an appropriate t ier-level in order to offer the 
necessary redundancy and resilience to the cloud computing services.  
the end result would be a win -win scenario where csps will have enough customers to sustain their 
businesses and cscs would lower their opex and have the reduced burden of maintaining own computing 
resources.
