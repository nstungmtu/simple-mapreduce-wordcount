1 scope 
this supplement describes the summary information of cloud computing interoperability activities of existing 
standards development organizations (sdos) and the groups , forums and open sources  developing the 
specifications that have potential to utilize cloud computing interoperability testing tools. this supplement 
also provides summary list of  activities by the sdos including those of cloud computing  interoperability 
testing areas.
