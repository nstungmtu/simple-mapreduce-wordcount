5 hardware-assisted 
memory virtualization 
– [b-ocp 2s] provides hardware-assisted memory virtualization as 'setting for 
the watchdog timer: the default setting for evt/dvt/pvt is disabled. the 
default setting for mp is enabled. the timeout value is 15 minutes and reset 
the system after the timer expires. the watchdog timer is always disabled 
after post' in clause 6.3.2. 
– [b-ocp hsas] provides hardware-assisted memory virtualization as 'the 
motherboard is designed to support dual intel xeon e5-2600 v3 and v4 
series processors and up to 2048gb lrdimm 3ds/1024gb lrdimm/ 512gb 
rdimm ddr4 memory. leveraging advanced technology from intel, the 
motherboard is capable of offering scalable 32- and 64- bit computing, high-
bandwidth memory design and lightning-fast pci-e bus implementation' in 
clause 7. 
– [b-ocp imbh] provides hardware-assisted memory virtualization as 'the 
efficiency performance motherboard, built with the intel xeon e5-2600 
processor, was originally was code-named the sandy bridge-ep 
motherboard' in clause 4. 
– [b-ocp oapm] provides hardware-assisted memory virtualization as 'amd 
epyc platform' in clause 5. 
– [b-ocp mb] provides hardware-assisted memory virtualization as 'intel 
motherboard v3.1 (also referred to "motherboard" or "the motherboard" in 
this document, unless noted otherwise) is based on intel xeon processor e5 -
2600 v3 (formerly code-named haswell-ep processor) product family cpu 
architecture' in clause 4.1. 
6 memory replacement – [b-ocp 2s] provides memory replacement as 'besides traditional ddr4 
dimm, the motherboard shall support non-volatile dimm (nvdimm) on all 
dimm slots' in clause 5.3.3. 
– [b-ocp dsbs] provides memory replacement as 'memory expansion :16 
sockets for un-buffered ddr3 and registered ddr3 dimms' and 'provide 16 
sockets for ddr4 dimms' in clause 4. 
– [b-ocp g1] provides memory replacement as '4 ddr3 memory channels per 
memory buffer; total 32 ddr3 rdimms, 1333 mhz (1dpc), 8/16/32gb' in 
clause 6.1. 
– [b-ocp hsas] provides memory replacement as 'the motherboard is 
designed to support dual intel xeon e5-2600 v3 and v4 series processors 
and up to 2048gb lrdimm 3ds/1024gb lrdimm/ 512gb rdimm ddr4 
memory. leveraging advanced technology from intel, the motherboard is 
capable of offering scalable 32- and 64- bit computing, high-bandwidth 
memory design and lightning-fast pci-e bus implementation' in clause 7. 
– [b-ocp mb] provides memory replacement as 'the motherboard has dimm 
subsystem designed as below: ddr4 direct attach memory support on cpu0 
and cpu1; 4x channels ddr4 registered memory interface on each cpu; 2x 
ddr4 slots per channel (total 16 dimm); support rdimm, lrdimm; support 
sr, dr and qr dimm; support ddr4 speeds of 1600/1866/2133; up to 
maximum 1024 gb with 64gb dimms; follow updated jedec ddr4 
specification with 288 pin dimm socket' in clause 5.3.2.
