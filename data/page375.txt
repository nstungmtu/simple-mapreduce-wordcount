[iso/iec 20547-1]  information technology – big data reference architecture – part 1: 
framework and application process 
 this technical report (under development) describes the framework of the 
big data reference architecture and the process for how a user of the 
standard can apply it to their particular problem domain. 
[iso/iec 20547-2]  information technology – big data reference architecture – part 2: use cases 
and derived requirements 
 this technical report (under development) would decompose a set of 
contributed use cases into general big data reference architecture
