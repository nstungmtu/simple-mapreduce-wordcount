8 overview of inter-cloud computing 
8.1 relationship between intra-cloud and inter-cloud handling of resources 
for collaboration among csps, two types of resources can be distinguished. one includes underlying physical 
resources of a cloud infrastructure which are controlled and managed by the csp who owns these resources. 
the othe r type includes resources which are abstracted from the underlying physical resources and are 
offered as services to csps. during the collaboration of csps, such abstracted resources are also utilized 
during interactions between these csps. 
based on the ab straction, underlying physical resources will become abstracted resources. detailed 
information of underlying physical resources, such as total central processing unit (cpu) cores and memories 
available in the infrastructure, will be hidden. during the collaboration among csps, only the information of 
abstracted resources, such as the cpu cores and memories dedicated to the given service, will be subject for 
interactions. 
figure 8-1 shows the relationship between intra-cloud and inter-cloud and their handling of resources.
