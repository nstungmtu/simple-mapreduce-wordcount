storage snapshot test description 
test purpose to verify that the csc preserves and recovers the state and data of storage. 
reference [itu-t y.3513] clause 7.2.2 
test sequence step type description result 
1 stimulus the csc takes a storage snapshot of storage a, called 
snapshot a.  
 
2 stimulus the csc changes the data of storage a.   
3 stimulus the csc takes another storage snapshot of storage a, called 
snapshot b. 
 
4 stimulus the csc restores snapshot a.   
5 check storage a's state and data are consistent with the states 
when snapshot a was taken. 
 
6 stimulus the csc deletes snapshot a.  
7 check snapshot a can be deleted without affecting snapshot b.   
8 stimulus the csc restores snapshot b.  
9 check storage a's state and data are consistent with the states 
when snapshot b was taken.

1 stimulus the csc takes a storage backup of storage a, called backup 
storage a. 
 
2 stimulus the csc changes the data in the storage a.   
3 stimulus the csc restores storage a with storage backup a.  
4 check configuration and data of backup storage a is consistent with 
storage a.
