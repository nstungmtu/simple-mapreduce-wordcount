i.4 use case of secure data management of the saas partition model in inter-cloud 
this use case illustrates secure data management of the saas partition model in inter-cloud. the inter-cloud 
federation pattern used to illustrate the use case is an example only. 
table i.4 – secure data management of the saas partition model in inter -cloud 
title secure data management of the saas partition model in inter-cloud 
description this case separates software logic and data, and deploys them on each csp to consider 
any inadvertent data breach during execution of cloud services in third party csps. this 
case considers data protection from malicious csp threats. 
for example, the software logic is deployed on csp-a and data a, b are stored on 
reliable cloud storage providers, csp-b and csp-c, respectively; the csp-a provides the 
saas securely using data a and b stored on csp-b and csp-c.
