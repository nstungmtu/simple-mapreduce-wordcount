with the help of secondary csps 
a given csp can act as a primary csp and secondary csp, i.e., using the services of secondary csps (e.g., csp 
a in figure 8-3) and providing services to a primary csp (e.g., csp a in figure 8-4).  
8.2.3 network connectivity  
in order to deliver cloud services based on the use of inter-cloud computing, network connectivity is required 
among the involved cscs, primary csps and secondary csps. specifically, this includes: 
– connectivity between peer csps. by means of this connectivity, a primary csp can interwork with 
the secondary csps to request a service (e.g., backup of data or transfer of virtual machines between 
connected csps). in some cases, this connectivity is provided on -demand; the connectivity is 
established instantaneously as the need arises and removed after the need disappears;
