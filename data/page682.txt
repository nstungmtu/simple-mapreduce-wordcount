networking layers used by the naas csp, covering interworking of the relevant c ontrol functionali ties, 
forwarding functionalities as well as management functionalities for each of these networking layers. 
7.7.1 functionalities for mapping between physical resources and virtualized networks 
as part of naas resource functionalities, th ese functionalities are responsible to support the mapping 
between underlying physical resources and virtualized networks exposed to the naas csc as part of naas 
services, via which, the near real -time utilization of underlying physical resources (physical nodes, physical 
links, etc) can be obtained. 
7.8 functionalities for an evolved real-time oss 
the oss functionalities for naas consist of a set of capabilities for accessing the relevant oss functions related 
to naas. they are related to functional components of the operations support systems defined in the multi-
layer functions. these functions span the layered framework of the cloud computing reference architecture 
(ccra). 
as presented in clause 6. 3, aspects to  be controlled and managed in real -time by t he oss include the 
following: 
− naas services; 
− network services (see definition in clause 3.2.3); 
− network functions (see definition in clause 3.2.2); 
− virtual cloud compute and storage (ccs) resources; 
− virtualized network connectivity; 
− physical resources (compute, storage, networking). 
figure 7-1 describes the organization of the oss functionalities to fulfil the management of the above aspects.
