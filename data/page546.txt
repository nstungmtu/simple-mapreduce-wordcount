figure (optional) 
 
pre-conditions (optional) the csps (saas) form an inter-cloud federation pattern.  
post-conditions

derived requirements unique data identity management (see clause 9.3) 
data encryption in cloud storage (se clause 9.3) 
i.5 use case of secure data management of the saas data partition model in inter-cloud 
this use case illustrates secure data management of the saas data replication model in inter-cloud. the inter-
cloud federation pattern used to illustrate the use case is an example only. 
table i.5 – secure data management of the saas data partition model in inter-cloud 
title secure data management of the saas data partition model in inter -cloud 
description this case partitions data and distributes fine-grained fragments of data to distinct 
clouds. none of the csps involved gains access to all the data, which safeguards data 
confidentiality. 
data is partitioned by two methods according to data type. in  unstructured data (e.g., 
picture, document), data can be partitioned using cryptographic data splitting. in 
database or structured data [e.g., extensible markup language (xml) data, log], 
data can be partitioned by distributing different parts of the data to different cloud 
service providers (csp-a, csp-b and csp-c).
