ii.8 use case 8 – cloud storage expansion 
a scientific organization (csc) collects very large volumes of data in a short period of time that will take years 
to study. they have sufficient cpu power to analyse this over time but the volume exceeds the storage 
capacity of their own cloud. csc contracts with csp -d to provide additional storage capacity. csc requests 
csp-a to provide very high bandwi dth connectivity between csc and csp -d. csc writes the incoming data 
directly to csp-d's cloud data storage, and then reduces the network bandwidth to normal levels. csc is now 
able to run queries on their data directly at csp-d or to download interesting parts of the data to their private 
cloud for intensive processing. 
ii.9 use case 9 – service delivery platform components 
a business conference organization (csc) wishes to rapidly develop and deploy an interactive media 
conferencing application to multiple venues for an upcoming event. csp-a offers a service delivery platform 
(sdp) that includes pre-built components for such services. the csc developers write their application using 
several off-the-shelf paas, naas and caas components provided by the sdp p latform and are thus able to 
quickly and reliably create a complex multimedia application and deploy this to csp-a's sdp.
