ii.2 customer-oriented cloud service provisioning on distributed cloud 
table ii.2 – customer-oriented cloud service provisioning on distributed cloud 
use case 
name customer-oriented cloud service provisioning on distributed cloud. 
abstract this use case describes customer-oriented service deployment on distributed cloud. 
a main benefit of distributed cloud is provisioning of a cloud service in close proximity to 
csc. for the provisioning, methods to support customer-oriented cloud service provisioning 
on distributed cloud are needed and is called service routing. the service routing includes 
packet routing, service awareness, etc. by service awareness on distributed cloud, a cloud 
service is deployed on a cloud in close proximity to the csc or the request of a cloud service 
is delivered to another cloud. accordingly, the service routing on distributed cloud enab les: 
– scaling or migrating a cloud service for supporting mobility as shown in figure <an 
example of scaling or migrating a cloud service for supporting mobility>;  
– deploying and providing a cloud service for low response time as shown in figure <  an 
example of deploying and providing a cloud service for low response time>; and
