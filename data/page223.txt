pre-conditions 
(optional) 
csp: cloud service operations manager wants to modify or expand the resources in a physical 
machine. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
a physical machine provides a cloud service. 
derived 
requirements 
– hot-plug support (see clause 7.6) 
– configuration of multiple processing units (see clause 7.1.5) 
– monitoring status of physical machine (see clause 7.1.4) 
 
table ii.3 – cold data storage resource – use case 
title cold data storage resource use case 
description cold data means data that is stored but almost never read again. the cloud storage service 
for cold data provides almost no limit storage capacity at a very low cost and the physical 
machine for cold data storage requires the highest capacity and the lowest cos t. the typical 
use case is a series of sequential writes, but random reads. as the physical machine is 
recommended to provide as much storage capacity as possible, it would have many large-
capacity disks. to provide a highly durable storage service, the physical machine is 
recommended to provide management function for the csp to manage and monitor the 
physical machine cluster and then the csp can rebuild the data in time when some failures 
happen, also the hot plug function is needed. physical machines usually support storage of 
different media to balance between cost and performance for different situations.
