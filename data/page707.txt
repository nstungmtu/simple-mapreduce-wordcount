concerning naas platform related requirements described in clause 8 of [itu-t y.3512], ''programmable naas 
platform'', ''isolation of service chain for tenants '' and ''flexible scaling of n aas platform'' requires that the 
oss functionalities be flexible and efficient enough to allow for the instantiation of network services, network 
functions and corresponding cloud computing resources in an automated manner. 
regarding naas connectivity related requirements identified in clause 9 of [itu -t y.3512], ''unified network 
control mechanism, ''elastic network reconfiguration '', ''leveraging transport networks dynamically '' and 
''seamless and end -to-end solution of bandwidth '', this requires that the  naas architecture provides oss 
functionalities that support the real-time control, management and orchestration of end-to-end connectivity 
across the naas cloud computing infrastructure as well as access and core network domains. 
i.6 mapping and derivation of functionalities for naas products and naas services development 
''integration of software applications'' requirements as described in clause 8.5 of [itu-t y.3512] implies that 
integration of these applications on the naas platform allows the building and design of combined solutions 
which will be tested prior to their deployment by the naas csp. functionalities for the development of naas 
services are therefore required to be supported in the naas architecture. 
i.7 mapping and derivation of functionalities related to naas business 
[itu-t y.3512] does not explicitly address requirements related to naas  business capabilities since the 
requirements in [itu-t y.3512] are related to the three types of naas services, i.e. , naas application, naas 
platform and naas connectivity. however , these business capabilities have to be addressed in the naas 
architecture to supp ort the management of naas service offerings by the naas csp including naas csc 
requests for selection and purchase of naas products and services available in the naas csp product 
catalogue.
