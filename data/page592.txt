– identifies the user profile managed by the user profile management function (see clause 7.3.2) if a 
daas user has already been registered; 
– coordinates with different virtualization infrastructures according to a delivery protocol, in some 
cases the client connection needs to be customized according to dedicated infrastructure; 
– sends virtual desktop access information and/or other formats like a customized access connector 
software, access connection plugins in a browser to a daas client to proceed with client connection; 
– performs connection monitoring for any type and reconnection with the connection monitoring if a 
daas client is disconnected; it also guarantees both security and quality of service (qos) of the 
delivered daas service based on the connection; 
– validates the license of the user's applications of virtual desktops. 
7.2.3 user access management 
the user access management function: 
– validates a daas user with csu's access information in logon procedure; 
 note 1 – csu's access information is registered at the portal of a daas platform or a daas user's terminal. this 
information includes id, password, and other check items for authority. this information can be used in login 
procedure. 
 note 2 – for a daas user who accesses daas for the first time, an administrator prepares csu 's access 
information for the daas user 's logon procedure in advance in the user account and profile management 
function (see clause 7.3.2). 
– accesses the user account and profile management function (see clause 7.3.2) for each daas client 
according to csc types, the information may be used to authorize access, establish connections with 
daas-specific protocol/connection; 
– notifies the result of a client connection to a daas client  to give guides to access a daas platform 
and requests the client connection to the client connection management function (see clause 7.2.2) 
after validating a daas user, the access can be achieved through a dedicated connector software or 
through a web browser and plugin supporting daas-specific protocol; 
– supports differentiated permissions according to csc types; 
 note 3 – the permissions are classified into authority of administration, resource access, and service access.  
– supports secure access through a security protocol (such as secure shell or transport layer security) 
and technical access depending on the type of daas client such as the dedicated software, general-
purpose web browser; 
– maintains logs such as the date and time of the user log-on and log-off, the type of daas client, the 
location of the daas client, and the service usage, etc. 
7.2.4 provisioning and allocation of virtual desktop 
the provisioning and allocation function: 
– prepares hardware and software resources for a virtual desktop corresponding with csu's account 
information, load-balancing or allocation policy; 
– configures a daas platform with a virtual desktop delivery protocol and resource pool for virtual 
desktop environments; 
 note 1 – this function involves the following processes: 
• the provision for a daas client configured to receive the allocation of a virtual desktop; 
• the provision for  a connection manager to control a type of a virtual desktop to be allocated 
according to csu's account and access information; 
• the provision for a daas platform to be selected among platforms in the datacentre or server 
farm on which the virtual desktop is allocated.
