(optional) 
– the csps(saas) form federation pattern of inter-cloud.

(optional) 
– the csps(saas) implement trust management system. 
– the csp(saas) uses reputation scores of csps.

requirements 
– inter-cloud trust policies and credentials (refer to clause 7.1). 
– inter-cloud reputation scoring (refer to clause 7.2). 
i.3 use case of selecting csp by reputation-based trust evaluation 
this use case illustrates reputation-based trust evaluation in inter-cloud. the intermediary pattern of inter-
cloud used to illustrate the use case is an example only. 
table i.3 – selecting csp by reputation-based trust evaluation 
title selecting csp by reputation-based trust evaluation  
description – the csc requests a saas service from csp1; 
– csp1 cannot provide the service by itself, it plans to fulfil the service with 
inter-cloud intermediary pattern in which csp1 acts as the intermediary; 
– all of csp2(saas), csp3(saas) and csp4(saas) can provide the service s csp1 
needs; 
– csp1 will select a csp as the secondary csp base on the reputation of them. 
in this step: 
1) if csp1 has an internal trust evaluation system, it will query and compare 
the reputation of csp2, csp3 and csp4 in this system and choose the best 
one to establish a trust relationship with; 
2) if csp1 does not have an internal trust evaluation system or there are no 
records about csp2, csp3 and csp4 in the internal system, csp1 should 
find a third-party trust evaluation system to query and compare the 
reputation data about these csps; 
– csp2(saas) is the best choice and csp1 establishes a trust relationship with it. 
roles csc, csp, csp(saas).
