   27 
the following daas general requirements are described in [itu-t y.3503] as follows: 
– support for high -definition (hd) and three -dimensional (3d) applications : daas can optionally 
support execution of hd applications on virtual desktops for cscs; 
– extensible storage: it is recommended that a csp support the storage extension requested by a csc; 
– response time: it is recommended that daas provide cscs with acceptable qoe; 
– high availability: it is recommended that high availability in terms of delivery and operation of daas 
be assured by a csp; 
– resiliency to disaster: in the case of a disaster, daas is recommended to provide and maintain an 
acceptable level of service; 
– service continuity: it is recommended that in the case of temporarily unavailable resource access, 
a csp provides the capability to preserve the state of the user session; 
– system scalability: it is recommended that daas supports elastic scalability of: 
• storage for daas user account information, virtual desktop environment settings and active and 
inactive virtual desktop environments; 
• processing and network capacity for the number of concurrent daas user connections and total 
daas users; 
• underlying daas resources. 
– daas developer environments : it is recommended to provide a developer environment for the 
service and contents regarding daas; 
– diversity of daas clients: it is recommended that the csp support a wide selection of daas clients. 
note – functional requirements for daas are provided in clause 8 of [itu -t y.3503]. 
10 general requirements for paas 
the general re quirements for platform as a service ( paas) derived from the use cases in clause i. 5 are as 
follows: 
– application hosting: it is required that the paas csp provides an application hosting environment, 
where the application can be rapidly deployed, reliabl y executed, flexibly expanded and isolated 
from other applications; 
– services delivery platform: it is recommended that the paas csp provides the capabilities of service 
presence, orchestration, billing, mash-up and tools for associated development and testing by cscs 
through a unified application programming interface (api); 
– integrated development environment : the paas csp can optionally provide comprehensive 
capabilities to cscs for software development such as coding, debugging, compiling and 
distribution; 
– development tools: paas csp can optionally provide development tools as a service to cscs, who 
can use it on-demand. 
11 general requirements for caas 
the general requirements for communication as a service (caas) derived from the use cases in clause i.6 are 
as follows: 
– communication capabilities openness: it is recommended that the csp provides apis for accessing 
communication capabilities of csns to enhance their own services by using communication 
enablers; 
– communication software development support: it is recommended that the csp provides support 
for communication software development, which is a group of comm unication building blocks, to 
csns in order to develop communication applications; 
 note – examples of communication building blocks are protocol stacks, codecs, authentication, etc.
