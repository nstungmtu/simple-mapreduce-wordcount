use case 
description 
this use case depicts the case where charging functionality is required in daas. the purpose of 
this use case is to show various environments of cscs that use common resources provided by 
the same csp. 
there are two actors in this diagram: csc and csp; they provide software and hardware.  
• the csp needs to manage daas user profiles including the types of users. (#1 in figure). 
• as, depending on the type of users, the rate for using resource can be offered differently, 
the csp manages the policy for resource usage. (# 2 in figure). 
• the csc uses resources (#3 in figure) and the csp manages software and hardware usage 
statics (#4 in figure). 
• the csp manages accounting (#5 in figure) by monitoring software and hardware usage 
statistics (use case 3). the csc can use storage, cpu and memory as in iaas, and whenever 
an application (software) runs on csp. daas also provides storage, cpu and memory. the 
csp needs to store accounting information of software and hardware usage whenever the 
usage occurs. 
• considering user profile, software and hardware usage statistics, and the policy of resource 
usage to reflect different types of usage, the csp produces bills and requests payment to 
cscs (#6 in figure).
