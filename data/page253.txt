table ii.2 – customer-oriented cloud service provisioning on distributed cloud 
use case 
– delivering request of a cloud service to neighbour edge cloud as shown in figure <an 
example of delivering a cloud service to neighbour edge cloud>. 
finally, customer-oriented service provisioning (i.e., service routing) method is highly 
required on distributed cloud in order to improve cloud service qos (e.g.,  response time, 
network bandwidth, mobility). 
note – provisioning of a cloud service in close proximity to cloud service c ustomer depends 
on condition of csc (e.g., location, qos level) and condition of surrounding csc 
(e.g., availability of edge cloud, capacity of edge cloud, network congestion).
