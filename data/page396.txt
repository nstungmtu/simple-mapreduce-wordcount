• itu-t y.3502 | iso/iec 17789 : this recommendation | international standard specifies the cloud 
computing reference architecture (ccra). the reference architecture includes the cloud computing 
roles, cloud computing activities, as well as the cloud computing functional components and their 
relationships.

• itu-t y.3510: this recommendation identifies requirements for cloud infrastructure capabilities to 
support cloud services. the scope of this recommendation includes: 
– overview of cloud infrastructure; 
– requirements for compute resources; 
– requirements for network resources; 
– requirements for storage resources; 
– requirements for resource abstraction and control.

• itu-t y.3511 : this recommendation describes the framework for interactions of multiple cloud 
service providers (csps) that is referred to as inter-cloud computing. based on several use cases and 
consideration of different types of service offerings, this recommendation describes the possible 
relationship between multiple csps, which are peering, federation and intermediary. by introducing 
the concept of the primary csp and /secondary csps, the recommendation further describes csp 
interactions in the cases of federation and intermediary patterns. the recommendation also 
considers the network significance and its issue s. finally, relevant functional requirements are 
derived.

• itu-t y.3512: this recommendation provides use cases and functional requirements of network as 
a service (naas), one of the representative cloud service categories. this recommendation covers 
the following: 
– high-level concept of naas;  
– functional requirements of naas; 
– typical naas use cases. 
– this re commendation provides use cases and functional requirements of naas application, 
naas platform and naas connectivity.
