• itu-t y.3500|iso/iec 17788: this recommendation | international standard provides an overview 
of cloud computing along with a set of terms, definitions and concepts. it is a terminology 
foundation for the cloud computing standardization work. 
 this recommendation | international standard is applicable to all types of organizations 
(e.g., commercial enterprises, government agencies, not-for-profit organizations).

• itu-t y.3502|iso/iec 17789 : this recommendation | international standard specifies the cloud 
computing reference architecture (ccra). the reference architecture includes the cloud computing 
roles, cloud computing activities, as well as the cloud computing functional components and their 
relationships.

• iso/iec 19086 -1: this document seeks to establish a set of common cloud sla building blocks 
(concepts, terms, definitions, contexts) that can be used to create cloud service level agreements 
(slas). this document specifies: a) an overview of cloud slas; b) identification of the relationship 
between the cloud service agreement and the cloud sla; c) concepts that can be used to build cloud 
slas; and d) terms commonly used in cloud slas. this document is for the benefit and use of both 
cloud service providers and cloud service customers. the aim is to avoid confusion and facilitate a 
common understanding between cloud service providers and cloud service customers. cloud service 
agreements and their associated cloud slas vary between cloud service providers, and in some 
cases different cloud service customers can negotiate different contract terms with the same cloud 
service provider for the same cloud service. this document aims to assist cloud service customers 
when they compare cloud services from different cloud service providers. this document does not 
provide a standard structure that can be used for a cloud sla or a standard set of cloud service level 
objectives (slos) and cloud service qualitative objectives (sqos) that will apply to all cloud services 
or all cloud service providers. this approach provides flexibility for cloud service providers in 
tailoring their cloud slas to the particular characteristics of the offered cloud services. this 
document does not supersede any legal requirement.
