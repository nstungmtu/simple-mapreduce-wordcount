– the vpn associated to the services  provided for naas csc matches naas csc's profile in terms of 
latency, speed, and bandwidth. 
the runtime vm migration configuration can be generated based on the vpc naas service model, together 
with the corresponding naas service operational policy model, which includes the aspects below: 
– the action is triggered by the event that an naas csc's location is changed (location near to another 
naas csp's data centre) and the network load between these two data centres is low; 
– the vm is migrated to the new data centre; 
– the vpn connecting an naas csc's services is updated. 
the above used network resources are managed by a resource abstraction and control functional component 
in the form of naas resource model, containing the network topology (physical and vi rtual interconnection 
of network elements, etc.), inventory (database of network elements, ports, device type, capabilities, etc.), 
protocol specific information, etc.
