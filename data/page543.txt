use case of inter-cloud data management 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this appendix includes inter -cloud data management -related use cases fr om which the corresponding 
functional requirements are derived. 
i.1 use case template 
the use cases developed in this appendix adopt the format in table i.1 for better readability and convenient 
material organization. 
table i.1 – use case template table 
title the title of the use case. 
description scenario description of the use case. 
roles roles involved in the use case. 
figure (optional) figure to explain the use case, but not mandatory. 
pre-conditions (optional) the necessary pre-conditions that should be achieved before starting the use case. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
the post-conditions that will be carried out after the termination of current use case. 
derived requirements requirements derived from the use cases, whose detailed description is pr esented in 
the dedicated clause. 
i.2 use case of data use policies in inter-cloud 
this use case illustrates data use policies aspect in inter -cloud. the inter -cloud federation pattern used to 
illustrate the use case is an example only. 
table i.2 – data use policies in inter-cloud 
title data use policies in inter-cloud 
description the csc requests saas, which operates its data in specific countries. the csp-a (saas) 
acts in an inter-cloud federation pattern among cpss (saas) and becomes the contact 
point for the csc. the csp-a (saas) determines and validates appropriate data use 
policies or principles that allow exchange and operational use of csc data among the 
inter-cloud federation. if the csp (saas) operates out of specific countries, csc data is 
not exchanged. 
roles csc, csp (saas).
