• [itu-t l.130 1] which establishes a minimum data set necessary to manage data centres and 
telecommunication rooms in an environmentally responsible manner. the recommendation 
specifies the communication interface and defines the parameters to be communicated depending 
on the type of equipment used in data centres, such as power systems (alternating current 
(ac)/direct current (dc) and uninterruptible power supply (ups) and energy distribution), cooling 
systems and ict equipment. 
• [itu-t l.1302] which specifies an energ y efficiency assessment methodology for data centres and 
telecom centres, test equipment accuracy requirements, assessment period, assessment conditions 
and calculation methods. 
• [itu-t l.1320] which contains the general definition of metrics, test procedures, methodologies and 
measurement profiles required to assess the energy efficiency of power and cooling equipment for 
telecommunications and data centres. 
8.1.5 other standards 
other standards would be developed as the need arises. 
8.2 human resources 
inadequate human resources to fully implement and utilise cloud computing services in developing countries 
has been identified as a constraint. in order to make cloud computing services a reality in developing 
countries, there is need to build human capacity and to develop the relevant skills in the following areas: 
• standards development; 
• auditing of cloud service provision to ensure compliance with the relevant regulations; 
• management of the cloud infrastructure and service provision to enable a smoot h migration and 
integration of cloud services as well as the execution of other legal and business processes; 
• regulation of the various facets of cloud service provision such as infrastructure installation and 
management; 
• cyber-security, service delivery and data protection; and 
• cloud applications development to create new opportunities for new services. 
8.3 data centres 
data centres are considered as one of the infrastructure requirements for supporting and enabling access to 
cloud services. for this purpose, the establishment of data centres in developing countries should take into 
account some pillars, including the following: 
• high availability: service continuity and high availability of data centres infrastructure, based on tier 
iii specifications of the [tia-942 standard], should be ensured; 
• security: data centres should be aligned with international data centre security standards (physical 
and environmental safety, technical security, …); 
• energy efficiency: ensuring the energy efficiency of data centres by increasing cooling efficiency and 
reducing power consumption is essential. redundancy of power and cooling supplies should also be 
guaranteed; 
• cloud readiness : in addition to the usual data centre services (such as dedicated private area , 
dedicated rack or colocation, dedicated server,…), data centres would be scalable and ready to 
support a wide range of cloud services such as virtual private server, virtual private cloud, cloud 
back-up, virtual load-balancer, virtual firewall, web hosting and elastic storage. for this reason, data 
centres should ensure higher connectivity to lans and storage area networks (sans) and use 
virtualization for multi-tenancy; and
