table ii.4 – test case: vm clone 
vm clone test description 
test purpose to verify that the csc clones a particular vm and the cloned vm has identical 
configuration and csp/csc data as the original one. 
reference [itu-t y.3513] clause 7.1.6 
test sequence step type description result 
1 stimulus the csc clones vm a, called vm a-1.   
2 stimulus the csc starts vm a.  
3 stimulus the csc starts vm a-1.  
4 check vm a and vm a-1 can run independently without affecting 
each other. 
 
5 check configuration and csp/csc data of vm a-1 is consistent with 
vm a. 
 
test verdict it is deemed as successfully terminated if all the checks are successful, otherwise it is 
deemed as failed. 
 
ii.1.5 test case: vm time synchronization 
table ii.5 shows the test case for vm time synchronization. 
table ii.5 – test case: vm time synchronization 
vm time synchronization test description 
test purpose to verify that the csc sets vm time synchronization manually or automatically.  
reference [itu-t y.3513] clause 7.1.8 
test sequence step type description result 
1 stimulus the csc synchronizes the vm a system time to a specified 
time manually. 
 
2 check the system time of vm a is consistent with the specified time 
in step 1. 
 
3 stimulus the csc configures the synchronization of vm a's time along 
with that of the host automatically. 
 
4 stimulus the csc logs in vm a and adjusts the system time to a 
different time. 
 
5 check the system time of vm a is synchronized with the host that 
the vm is running on. 
 
test verdict it is deemed as successfully terminated if all the checks are successful, otherwise it is 
deemed as failed. 
 
ii.1.6 test case: vm reservation 
table ii.6 shows the test case for vm reservation.
