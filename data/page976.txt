provided to the cloud service customer (3.1.5) is real time interaction and collaboration. 
note – caas can provide both application capabilities type and platform capabilities type. 
3.1.10 community cloud [b-itu-t y.3500]: cloud deployment model where cloud services (3.1.4) 
exclusively support and are shared by a specific collection of cloud service customers (3.1.5) who have shared 
requirements and a relationship with one another, and where resources are controlled by at least one 
member of this collection. 
3.1.11 data controller [b-key definition]: a person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other
