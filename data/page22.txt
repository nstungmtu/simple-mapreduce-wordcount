1 framework and requirements for cloud computing

– reversibility: a process for the cloud service customer to retrieve their cloud service customer data 
and application artefacts  and for the cloud service provider  to delete all cloud service customer 
data as well as contractually specified cloud service derived data after an agreed period; 
– security: ranges from physical secur ity to application security, and includes requirements such as 
authentication, authorization, availability, confidentiality, identity management, integrity, 
non-repudiation, audit, security monitoring, incident response, and security policy management; 
– service levels and service level agreement : the cloud computing service level agreement (cloud 
sla) is a service level agreement between a cloud service provider and a cloud service customer 
based on a taxonomy of cloud computing specific terms to set the q uality of the cloud services 
delivered. it characterizes quality of the cloud services delivered in terms of: 1) a set of measurable 
properties specific to cloud computing  (business and technical) and 2) a given set of cloud 
computing roles (cloud service customer and cloud service provider and related sub-roles). 
many of these cross cutting aspects, when combined with the key characteristics of cloud computing , 
represent good reasons for using cloud computing. however, cross cutting aspects like se curity, protection 
of pii, and governance have been identified as major concerns and in some cases an impediment to the 
adoption of cloud computing.
