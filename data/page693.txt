8.3.3 oss-nf functional components 
note – the following description is bas ed on an adaptation of the oss functional components as described in clause 
9.2.5.3 of [itu-t y.3502]. 
the oss-nf functional components encompass the set of operational related management capabilities that 
are required in order to manage and control the network functions offered to customers as part of network 
services. refer to clause 7.8.2.2 for a description of oss-nf functionalities. 
figure 8-5 shows the oss-nf functional components. 
 
figure 8-5 – oss-nf functional components 
the oss-nf functional components include: 
– nf catalogue; 
– nf provisioning; 
– nf monitoring and reporting; 
– nf policy management; 
– nf automation; 
– nf level management; 
– nf incident and problem management; 
– nf inventory. 
8.3.3.1 nf catalogue 
the nf catalogue functional component provides a listing of all network functions of the naas csp. the nf 
catalogue functional component contains and/or references all relevant technical information required to 
deploy, provision and run a network function. 
8.3.3.2 nf provisioning 
the nf provisioning functional component provides the capabilities for provisioning network functions, both 
in terms of the p rovisioning of network functions implementations and of network functions access 
endpoints and the workflow required to ensure that necessary nf elements are provisioned in the correct 
sequence. 
8.3.3.3 nf monitoring and reporting 
the nf monitoring and reporting functional component provides capabilities for: 
– monitoring the activities of other functional components throughout the naas csp's system. this 
also includes functional components involved in the support of network functions, such as other 
oss-nf functional components like the nf automation functional component (e.g., the provisioning 
of a network functions instance for a particular customer);
