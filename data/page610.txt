appendix ii 
 
relationship between daas functions and functional components in cloud 
computing reference architecture 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
table ii.1 provides the relationship between daas functions in clause 7 and functional components of cloud 
computing reference architecture defined in [itu -t y.3502] by enumerating all the related functional 
components corresponding to d aas functions. the term "related functional components" in this appendix 
means that the description of the functional component in [itu -t y.3502] is similar to that of the daas 
function but does not mean that the functional component in [itu -t y.3502] can replace or cover for the 
daas function.

platform 
virtualization 
virtualization resource layer- 
resource abstraction 
and control 
resource abstraction and control fc includes 
software elements such as hypervisors, virtual 
machines, virtual data storage, and time-
sharing. 
platform and virtualization management fc 
provides the capabilities for virtualizing the use 
of those resources (e.g., by means of 
hypervisors). 
resource 
assignment 
resource assignment resource layer- 
resource abstraction 
and control 
resource abstraction and control fc provides 
access to the physical computing resources 
through software abstraction.

resource layer- 
physical resources 
physical resources include hardware resources, 
such as computers (cpu and memory), networks 
(routers, firewalls, switches, network links and 
network connectors, storage components (hard 
disks) and other physical computing 
infrastructure elements.

delivery of virtual desktop means access of 
service. service object is a virtual desktop in 
daas.

connection management fc provides 
enforcement of qos policies regarding the 
traffic from and/or to the user layer. this is 
related with connection monitoring, 
reconnection on the daas side. 
user access

access layer- 
access control 
validating a daas user and secure access are 
tightly associated with the access control fc and 
the authentication and identity management fc.
