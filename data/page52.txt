methodology and edition plan of this recommendation 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this recommendation adopts a use-case-driven approach. use cases are selected and elaborated first. based 
on these use cases, relevant requirements are derived. as an example shown in figure ii.1, one use case may 
derive multiple requirements.  
 
figure ii.1 – methodology including mapping of use cases and requirements 
the use-case-driven approach may also ease the preparation of future editions of this recommendation. as 
explained in figure ii.2, a new edition will include new use cases with derived new requirements.  
 
figure ii.2 – editions of this recommendation 
note – for the sake of readability, this recommendation describes the requirements with short titles. exact description 
of short titles is provided in relevant clauses of this recommendation.  
table ii.1 presents the edition plan of this recommendation based on the progress of the corresponding 
content.
