i.9 end-to-end cloud resource management use case 
use case 
name end-to-end cloud resource management use case 
abstract a csc uses a service offered by multiple csps and/or csns, one of which supports customer 
services. in order to deliver customer services properly, the csn manages end-to-end health 
and qos of the service offered by a csp which can integrate several base services offered by 
multiple csps.

figure 
 
 
as shown in the above figure, this problem requires visibility into csp2's management systems 
delivering the voice application service, as well as similar csp's management systems. when 
the voice application customer calls into csp2 support, then the csp2 support person should 
have visibility into the health and welfare of the csp1's voice application service, its underlying 
cloud infrastructure, as well as the local service provider's network management systems 
relevant to the voice application service.
