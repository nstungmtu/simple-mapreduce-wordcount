• carrier ethernet services for cloud use cases:  
– includes both single and multiple ethernet cloud carrier domain cases; 
– part1: for cloud provider interconnect (cp to cp); 
– part2: for enterprise access to cp.  
• carrier ethernet services for cloud management interface profile:  
– identify relevant protocol neutral mef 7.x objects (and attributes); 
– operational use cases and information requirements for cp to ecc management interface; 
– focus on reconfiguration of specific service attributes (e.g., cir);  
– phase 1 approach: changes to service attributes occur only when evc/ovc is inactive or during 
a maintenance interval; 
– explore scheduled reconfiguration and configuration durations; 
– provide interface operational requirements: number of changes allowed over time (how long 
change should last); lead time for request fulfilment; 
– describe slss for management interactions (performance metrics).
