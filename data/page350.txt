table i.7 – intelligent transport big data analysis 
pre-conditions – the speed sensors and high-resolution cameras are installed at intersections and key points 
of roads in the city and outskirts. 
– the traffic of vehicles and the status of roads data are collected in real time.  
– the big data applications for intelligent transport systems are built upon the private or 
public big data infrastructure. 
post-conditions – real time and accurate route navigation based on the shortest path algorithm and route 
traffic could be provided to private and business vehicle drivers of all types of vehicles on 
the road except drivers of track vehicles. 
– accurate scheduling for bus departures is established on the real time analysis and 
prediction of road traffic. 
– automatic recognition of violations of road traffic laws such as speeding, running red lights, 
drink-driving, running through restricted areas, fatigue driving, etc.
