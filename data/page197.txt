i.1.1 open compute project 
the open compute project (ocp) is a rapidly growing community of engineers around the world whose 
mission is to design and enable the delivery of the most efficient server, storage and data centre hardware 
designs available for scalable computing. 
the ocp server project provides standardized server system specifications for scale computing. 
standardization is key to ensure that the ocp specification pool does not get fragmented by point solutions 
that plague the industry today. the server project collaborates with the other ocp disciplines to ensure broad 
adoption and achieve optimizations throughout all aspects from validation, to manufacturing, deployments, 
data centre operations and de-commissioning. 
table i.1 lists ocp related specifications.
