the oss-ns will handle the management of network service chains including the automated deployment, 
policy management and profile management of network service chains. by routing traffic flows according to 
a 'service graph ', service chains address the requirement for optimization of the network through the 
provisioning of network services that are tailored to the customer context. 
7.8.2.2 oss-network functions 
the oss -network functions (oss -nf) fun ctionalities are responsible for the management of network 
functions such as instantiation, update, query, scaling, and termination of network functions. the services 
provided by the oss-nf can be consumed by other functionalities such as the oss-ns (see clause 7.8.2.1). 
in accordance with clause 10.4 of [itu-t y.3521], the oss-nf include functionalities such as: 
– catalogue management of network functions with their relevant descriptions and software; 
– network functions ' order management functionalities i ncluding the automated creation, 
modification and termination of network functions ' instances (including instances of network 
functions' components and their inter-connectivity); 
– network functions' assurance functions such as performance management and, fault management 
of network functions instances; these functions include monitoring of network functions' instances, 
calculating and performing restoration activities when monitoring detects one or more faulty 
network functions' instances as well as reporting status of network functions' instances to clients of 
oss-nf, e.g., oss-ns functionalities; 
– inventory management of network functions instances; 
– usage collection and distribution of network functions instances. 
7.8.2.3 oss-cloud compute and storage 
the oss-cloud compute and storage (oss-ccs) functionalities are responsible for the management of virtual 
compute and storage resources. the functionalities provided b y the oss -ccs can be used by other oss 
functionalities such as the oss-ns (see clause 7.8.2.1) or the oss-nf (see clause 7.8.2.2). 
in accordance with clause 10.4 of [itu-t y.3521], the oss-ccs includes functionalities such as: 
– catalogue management of cloud compute and storage resources; 
– resource order management functionalities such as the allocation, modification and termination of 
virtual compute and storage resources; 
– resource assurance functions such as performance management and fault management of 
allocated virtual compute and storage resources; 
– inventory management of allocated virtual compute and storage resources; 
– usage collection and distribution of virtual compute and storage resources. 
7.8.2.4 oss-network connectivity 
the oss -network connectivity (oss -nc) functionalities are responsible for the management  of network 
connectivity resources. the oss-nc functionalities can be used by other oss functionalities such as the oss-
ns (see clause 7.8.2.1) the oss-nf (see clause 7.8.2.2) or the oss-ccs (see clause 7.8.2.3). 
in accordance with clause 10.4 of [itu-t y.3521], the oss-nc includes functionalities such as: 
– resource order management functionalities such as allocation, modification and termination of 
virtualized network connectivity resources such as virtualized networks, links, sub-networks; 
– resource assurance functionalities such as performance management and fault management of 
allocated virtualized network connectivity resources; 
– inventory management of allocated virtualized network connectivity resources; 
– usage management of virtualized network connectivity resources. 
the oss-nc functionalities can be consumed by other naas functionalities such as oss-ns (see clause 7.8.2.1) 
or oss-naas functionalities (see clause 7.8.1). control  plane functions are topology and device detection,
