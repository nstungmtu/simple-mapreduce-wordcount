i.1 service management interface 
 
title service management interface 
description csp1 and csp 2 established an inter-cloud relationship. each of them has their own e2e cloud 
service lifecycle management system inside. 
csp1 defines a software enabled service and provides the corresponding service management 
interface (smi).  
csn makes use of the smi capabilities provided by csp1 and develops a new implementation 
of cloud service a1.  
csn registers the developed cloud service a1.  
the status, availability, performance and/or delay time of a service a1 can be collected through 
smi. 
the csp1 provides his cloud service a1 to csp2.  
csc requests a composite service c1 to csp2. this composite service includes the a1 service  
offered by csp1 which provides a service and management to csc.  
the e2e cloud service lifecycle management system of csp1 provisions and operates service a1 
through its smi. 
the e2e cloud service lifecycle management system of csp1 collects (according to local laws 
and regulations) service health condition, performance, security, geo -location and events 
results of the service a1through its smi. 
the e2e cloud service lifecycle management system of csp1 reports (according to local laws 
and regulations) service health condition, performance, security, geo -location of the service a1 
events results internally to csp1. 
the e2e cloud service lifecycle management system of csp1 can report the service health 
condition of service a1 externally to csp2 through smi between csps .
