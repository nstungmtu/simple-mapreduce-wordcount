table iii.1 – alignment analysis with functional requirements in [itu-t y.3513] 
 
functional requirements in [itu-t y.3513] test objects in this recommendation 
26 7.2 storage 
service 
functional 
requirements 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides storage functions, such as block 
level storage, file level storage and object-
based storage, with specific slas and 
charging model to the csc. the storage 
functions can be provided to the csc directly 
or used by the virtual machine as attached 
storage. 
– 8.6 interoperability testing of 
storage life cycle management 
between the csc and csp  
27 
 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides the csc with operations handling 
mechanisms related to storage, such as 
create, attach, detach, query and delete a 
volume of storage at either block level or 
file-system level, write, read and delete data 
for a given storage. 
– 8.6 interoperability testing of 
storage life cycle management 
between the csc and csp  
28 
 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides storage utilisation information in 
response to queries from the csc. 
– 8.7 interoperability testing of 
storage utilization status inquiring 
between the csc and csp 
29 7.2.1 storage 
migration 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides storage migration functions. based 
on migration policies, data can be migrated 
between different logical unit numbers 
(luns), different storage devices, local 
storage to shared storage and vice versa. 
– 8.1 interoperability testing of 
storage migration between the csc 
and csp 
30 7.2.2 storage 
snapshot 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides storage with snapshot functions. 
snapshot can be realized at either block or 
file-system levels. the data can be restored 
using the snapshot. 
– 8.2 interoperability testing of 
storage snapshot between the csc 
and csp 
31 7.2.3 storage 
backup 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides storage with backup functions. 
backup can be realized at block level, file 
level or object-based storage. 
– 8.3 interoperability testing of 
storage backup between the csc 
and csp 
32 7.2.4 i/o 
performance 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides input/output (i/o) limitation for 
each vm. 
– 8.5 interoperability testing of i/o 
performance between the csc and 
csp 
33 7.2.5 storage 
resource 
reservation 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides storage resource (e.g., storage 
space and lun) reservation functions. 
– 8.4 interoperability testing of 
storage resource reservation 
between the csc and csp 
34 7.3 network 
service 
functional 
requirements 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides network functions, such as ip 
address, vlan, virtual switch, load balance, 
firewall, with specific slas or charging 
model. network functions are applied to 
access and interconnect processing and 
storage resources. 
– 9.7 interoperability testing of load 
balance between the csc and csp 
– 9.8 interoperability testing of 
firewall between the csc and csp 
35 
 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides network information in response to 
queries from the csc. 
– 9.10 interoperability testing of 
network information inquiring 
between the csc and csp
