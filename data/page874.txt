• infrastructure capabilities type interoperability testing 
• platform capabilities type interoperability testing 
• application capabilities type interoperability testing. 
as shown in figure 1, there are three different target areas of cloud computing interoperability testing as

• "csc – csp", dealing with interaction between csc and csp  
• "csp – csp", dealing with collaboration among different csps 
• "csp – management", dealing with csp management functions.

also, the cloud architecture in terms of the common set of cloud computing functional co mponents are 
described in [itu -t y.3502]. figure 2 presents a high level overview of the ccra functional components 
organized by means of the layering framework.
