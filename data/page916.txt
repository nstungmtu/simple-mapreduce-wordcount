table iii.1 – alignment analysis with functional requirements in [itu-t y.3513] 
 
functional requirements in [itu-t y.3513] test objects in this recommendation 
17 7.1.6 vm 
clone 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides a virtual machine with clone 
functions. the cloned vm has identical 
configuration and csp/csc data as the 
original one. 
– 7.4 interoperability testing of vm 
clone between the csc and csp 
18 7.1.7 vm 
backup 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides a virtual machine with backup 
functions. when the vm becomes faulty or 
its data is lost, the vm can be restored using 
its backup stored according to the csc 
policy. 
– 7.10 interoperability testing of vm 
backup between the csc and csp 
19 7.1.8 vm time 
synchronizati
on 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides time synchronization functions, 
which allow the csc to control the vm time. 
– 7.5 interoperability testing of vm 
time synchronization between the 
csc and csp 
20 7.1.9 vm 
reservation 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides processing resources reservation 
(such as cpu, memory) functions. resources 
reservation is used to reserve available 
resources from iaas infrastructure before 
vm is initiated. 
– 7.6 interoperability testing of vm 
reservation between the csc and 
csp 
21 7.1.10 vm 
image 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp offers 
the ability for the csc to provide and use 
virtual machine images. a vm image consists 
of infrastructure configuration and csp data, 
csc data or both. 
– 7.7 interoperability testing of vm 
image between the csc and csp 
22 
 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
supports a different machine image format. 
– 7.7 interoperability testing of vm 
image between the csc and csp 
23 
 
– it is required that the iaas csp provides 
operation handling mechanisms related to 
image，including, but not limited to, add, 
import, store, register, deregister, query, 
update, delete and export. 
– 7.7 interoperability testing of vm 
image between the csc and csp 
24 7.1.11 vm 
template 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
supports the open virtualization format 
(ovf) template, which is a packaging 
standard designed to address the portability 
and deployment of virtual appliances. 
– 7.8 interoperability testing of vm 
template between the csc and csp 
25 
 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides operations handling mechanisms 
related to machine templates, such as 
upload, update, disable, enable, query and 
delete to the csc. 
– 7.8 interoperability testing of vm 
template between the csc and csp
