8.2 performance 
referring to [itu-t y.3502], this recommendation identifies additional performance metrics and indicators 
relating to the operation of a big data service, such as: 
– realtime performance metrics, such as automatic fault tolerance and database extensibility; 
– elastic calculation performance indicators, such as connections per second and packets per second; 
– storage performance indicators, such as bandwidth and input/output preferences per second; 
– data disaster tolerance performance indicators including recovery point indicator. 
9 security considerations 
security aspects for consideration within the cloud computing environment, especially for bdaas, are 
addressed by security challenges for csps, as described in [b -itu-t x.1601]. in particular, [b -itu t x.1601] 
analyses security threats and challenges, and describes security capabilities that could mitigate these threats 
and meet the security challenges. 
[b-itu-t x.1631] provides guidelines supporting the implementation of information security controls for cscs 
and csps. many of the guidelines guide the csps to assist the cscs in implementing the controls, and guide 
the cscs to implement such controls. selection of appropriate information security controls, and the 
application of the implementation guidance provided, will depend on a risk assessment as well as any legal, 
contractual, regulatory or other cloud-sector specific information security requirements. 
it is also recommended that the guidelines for csc data security described in [b-itu-t x.1641] are considered. 
it provides generic security guidelines for the csc data in cloud computing, analyses the csc data security 
life-cycle and proposes security requirements at each stage of the data life-cycle.
