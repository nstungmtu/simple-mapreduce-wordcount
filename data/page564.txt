7 daas general requirements  
the daas general requirements are described in [itu-t y.3501] as follows: 
• quality of experience (qoe); 
• fast boot-up time; 
• configurability of the virtual environment; 
• single sign-on access control. 
additional general requirements of daas derived from use cases (cf. appendix ii i) include (but are not 
limited to): 
• support for high -definition ( hd) and three-dimensional (3d) applications : daas can optionally 
support execution of hd applications on virtual desktops for cscs. 
 note 1 – hd and/or 3d applications (e.g., high-definition 3d videos or games) are becoming one of the major 
user demands in the personal computing device market.  
• extensible storage: it is recommended that a csp support the storage extension requested by a csc. 
• response time: it is recommended that daas provide cscs with acceptable qoe. 
 note 2 – detailed relevant information on acceptable response time is described in appendix iv. 
• high availability: it is recommended that high availability in terms of delivery and operation of daas 
be assured by a csp. 
• resiliency to disaster : in a case of a disaster, daas is recommende d to provide and maintain an 
acceptable level of service. 
 note 3 – this includes preserving the system information and the users' data including their virtual desktop 
state such as power-on, power-off, suspend, etc.  
• service continuity: it is recommended that in case of temporarily unavailable resource access, a csp 
provides the capability to preserve the state of the user session. 
• system scalability: it is recommended that daas supports elastic scalability of: 
– storage for daas user account informati on, virtual desktop environment settings, an d active 
and inactive virtual desktop environments; 
– processing and network capacity for the number of concurrent daas user connections and total 
daas users; 
– underlying daas resources. 
• daas developer environ ments: it is recommended to provide a developer environment for the 
service and contents regarding daas. 
• diversity of daas client: it is recommended that the csp support a wide selection of daas clients. 
 note 4 – examples of such daas clients are described in appendix ii.  
8 daas functional requirements 
8.1 operation and management requirements 
operation and management requirements include: 
• unified management interface : it is recommended that the csc be capable of deploying, 
configuring, managing and monitoring the daas through a unified management interface. 
• user account provisioning: it is recommended that the csp provide the method of operating and 
provisioning various types of accounts in accordance with csc's characteristics based on the service 
level such as one -time usage and permanent account, types of virtual desktop environments, and 
allocating options for the virtual desktop environments. 
 note 1 – user account provisioning depending on the csc types is described in appendix v.
