model description 
model 0 
 
model 0 is a shape of cloud computing. 
model 1 
(regional – core) 
 
model 1 is a shape of a distributed cloud in which the core cloud and the regional 
cloud are configured together. cloud services are provided from one or more 
clouds among the regional cloud and the core cloud. 
the regional cloud is hosted for a cloud service from the core cloud to a particular 
region to support localization of cloud services. the regional cloud assists the core 
cloud by mitigating traffic of cloud service.
