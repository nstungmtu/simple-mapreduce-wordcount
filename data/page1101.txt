6 overview  
according to [itu-t y.3500], cloud computing has been defined as "a paradigm for enabling network access 
to a scalable and elastic po ol of shareable physical or virtual resources with self -service provisioning and 
administration on-demand."  
6.1 key characteristics 
cloud computing is a dynamic concept that keeps evolving. according to [itu -t y.3500], the key 
characteristics of cloud computing include: 
i) on demand access which allows cloud service customers (cscs) to make use of the resources as and 
when required;  
ii) cost effectiveness as it readily reduces the capital expenditure (capex) of organizations allowing 
them to divert resources to operational expenditure (opex);  
iii) high scalability as it offers little time to implementation enabling the cscs to promptly customize 
and adjust the cloud computing capabilities according to their needs; 
iv) energy saving as the same resources are being utilized by multiple tenants; and 
v) increased level of convenience as only broadband internet access is required which can be accessed 
over a varied range of terminals such as tablets, laptops, workstations and mobile phones.
