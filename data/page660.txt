pre-conditions 
(optional)  
– csc accesses the iaas through portal with appropriate security mechanism and 
retrieves the functions exposed that are related to computing. 
post-conditions 
(optional)   
description – csc accesses and queries the csp portal to retrieve the list of supported functions 
necessary for computing functions. 
– csc selects the appropriate template and image from the query results and requests 
csp to create a virtual machine or physical machine based on the selection. 
– csp creates a virtual machine or physical machine from the computing resource pool 
based on the information provided by the csc. 
– csc requests csp to start up the virtual machine or physical machine.  
– csc manages and monitors the created virtual machine or physical machine during its 
lifecycle. it includes, but not limited to: 
• start, shutdown, suspend, restore, hibernate, wakeup and delete the virtual 
machine; 
• start, shutdown, hibernate and wakeup physical machine; 
• query the virtual machine or physical machine information and its status; 
• set migration or scaling policies for the virtual machine; 
• scaling the virtual machine; 
• execute performance metrics; 
• snapshot, backup, clone the virtual machine; 
• configure vm time synchronization; 
• reservation computing resource; 
• make image based on the virtual machine; 
• generate template based on the virtual machine. 
requirements  – physical machine (refer to clause 7.1.1) 
– virtual machine (refer to clause 7.1.2) 
– vm migration (refer to clause 7.1.3) 
– vm scaling (refer to clause 7.1.4) 
– vm snapshot (refer to clause 7.1.5) 
– vm clone (refer to clause 7.1.6) 
– vm backup (refer to clause 7.1.7) 
– vm time synchronization (refer to clause 7.1.8)
