other information for cloud services 
there are cloud service applications that provide functions for managing information by adding cloud service 
derived data to the cloud service customer data. identifying such cloud service derived data as assets and 
maintaining them in the inventory of assets can contribute to improving information security. 
8.1.2 ownership of assets 
control 8.1.2 and the associated implementation guidance and other information specified in iso/iec 27002

other information for cloud services 
the ownership of assets will likely vary depending on the category of the cloud service being used. application 
software will belong to the cloud service customer when using a platform as a service (paas) or infrastructure 
as a service (iaas) service, whereas for a  software as a service (saas) service, the application software will 
belong to the cloud service provider. 
8.1.3 the acceptable use of assets 
control 8.1.3 and the associated implementation guidance and other information specified in iso/iec 27002

implementation guidance for cloud services 
cloud service customer cloud service provider 
the cloud service customer should label information 
and associated assets maintained in the cloud 
computing environment in accordance with the cloud 
service customer's adopted procedures for labelling. 
where applicable, functionality provided by the cloud 
service provider that supports labelling can be adopted. 
the cloud service provider should document and 
disclose any service functionality it provides allowing 
cloud service customers to classify and label their 
information and associated assets.  
8.2.3 handling of assets 
control 8.2.3 and the associated implementation guidance and other information specified in iso/iec 27002
