b.2 virtualized network 
virtualized network functional component provides virtualized network elements, such as virtual nodes, 
ports, switches and links.  each tenant is represented by one virtualized network and different tenants can 
only discover their own virtualized network. all virtualized network elements are mapped to at least one 
physical element and can be enabled, disabled, modified or reorganised at runtime. 
note â€“ a virtualized network element is a broader concept than vnf. it can  be a vnf but also can correspond to a 
network port or network link. 
b.3 physical-virtualized-networks mapping 
physical-virtualized-networks mapping functional component  enforces the mapping between virtualized 
(overlay) networks and physical (underlay) networks. the mapping contents are stored in a database, which 
can be accessed by both physical and virtualized networks.
