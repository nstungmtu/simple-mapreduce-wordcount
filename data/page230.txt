table ii.8 – configurations of clustering processing units – use case 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
physical machines can run a cloud service efficiently and elastically according to the desired 
performance. 
derived 
requirements 
– configuration of multiple processing units (see clause 7.1.5) 
– multiple cpus (see clause 7.1.1.1) 
– adding processing units (see clause 7.4) 
– adding sub-components of processing units (see clause 7.4) 
– network topology (see clause 7.1.5) 
– interconnect network supports (see clause 7.1.5) 
– device driver and api supports (see clause 7.2) 
 
table ii.9 – replacing components of a physical machine – use case 
title a use case of replacing components of physical machine 
description this use case covers the situation where  components of physical machine be replaced. after 
deployment and operation, a component of physical machine may need to be replaced with 
another new one due to component failure. in addition, a component could be replaced with 
component of other model to upgrade the performance.  
typically, physical machine should support replacement of the main components, including 
cpu, memory, storage, power supply and cooling component.

to support replacement, the components are not coupled to the physical machine so that 
the components can be installed or uninstalled dynamically. typically, the components are 
designed to follow certain specifications to ensure compatible interface and shape . 
pre-conditions 
(optional) 
csp wishes to replace some components of physical machines to fix components failure or 
upgrade components. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
physical machine can runs normally with the new components. 
derived 
requirements 
– cpu replacement (see clause 7.1.1.1) 
– memory replacement (see clause 7.1.1.2) 
– storage replacement (see clause 7.1.1.3) 
– processing unit replacement (see clause 7.4) 
– equipment for mounting and removal (see clause 7.1.4) 
– power supply replacement (see clause 7.1.2) 
– cooling component replacement (see clause 7.1.3)
