use of smi-based model across various cloud architecture layers 
(this annex forms an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this annex describes smi-based models that can be used across various cloud computing architecture layers. 
the following figure provides an example of mapping the e2e smi concept onto the cloud computing 
reference architecture [itu-t y.3502]. 
 
figure a.1 â€“ example mapping of smi to cloud computing reference architecture 
in figure a.1, a number of example smis are identified. 
firstly, an enterprise csc 's management interface into a cloud service, documented in [itu -t y.3502] as 
"administer cloud service", is im plemented as an smi. the interface is routed via the access layer for 
connectivity and access control purposes. 
secondly, as shown in [itu -t y.3520] to support inter -cloud scenarios [itu -t y.3511], it is possible for one 
csp to act as the csc of another, and as such it can employ the same type of smi as in the first case. this is 
illustrated above in the smis between the bss of csp -b (acting as a csu) and the access layer of csp-c. this 
can then be cascaded through additional csps if desirable. 
thirdly, an operator's management console may employ multiple smis to different services and providers. in 
reference architecture terms, such a console is also acting as a csc, although a very specialised one. 
thus the same smi concept [itu-t y.3520] is being used in every case.
