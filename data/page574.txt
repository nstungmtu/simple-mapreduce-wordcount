cscs access the home applications and data hosted in virtual desktops which are created 
within a daas platform in home. this type of service can support a computer for multi-users 
with own virtual desktops in small area. cscs can access their own virtual machine with any 
daas clients through a delivery protocol for virtual desktops in home. since csc's access is 
taken in local area in this application, a certain access protocol can be adopted for the 
dedicated network or the dedicated daas client. csp can distribute the package  for server 
management and installation to support configuration functions by on -line or off-line ways.
