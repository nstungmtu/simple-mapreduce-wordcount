• tr-317: network enhanced residential gateway. this document specifies the network enhanced 
residential gateway (nerg) architecture. nerg consists in shifting some of the functionality of a 
residential gateway (rg), as defined in tr-124 to the operator's network.

• tr-328: virtual business gateway. this technical report specifies architecture and requirements for 
the virtual business gateway. the virtual business gateway architecture supports the migration of 
functionalities running on a business gateway to the network service provider's infrastructure to 
enable network-based features and services. such migration is expected to simplify the deployment 
and management of the network and business services.

• tr-345: this technical report describes how virtualized network functions (vnfs) and their 
supporting network function virtualization infrastructure (nfvi) can be integrated with these 
broadband forum architectures. this includes scenarios where nfvi is connected directly to a tr -
101 access network and also where vnfs are deployed behind an ms-bng as part of a service graph.

• tr-359: a framework for virtualization. this document significantly enhances the architectural 
modelling of the management and control of the multi -service broadband network (msb n). this 
document combined with tr-384 provides foundational underpinning of bbf work.

• tr-384: cloud-based central office (cloudco) reference architectural framework. this document 
specifies the recasting of a central office hosting infrastructure utilizing sdn, nfv and cloud 
technologies and aligned with the forum’s open broadband (ob) vision. cloudco enables 
significantly faster and more efficient provisioning of new cloud -based services to provide rapid 
availability of new revenue generating services. collectively the transformational nature of the 
cloudco structure and defined functions facilitate choice, ada ptability, migration/coexistence and 
implementation with 'open source' to enable agility and a differentiation at the functional level.
