relationship between daas logical components and the cloud computing 
reference architecture 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this appendix provides the relationship between daas logical components, which are described in clause 6.2, 
and the cloud computing reference architecture [b-itu-t fgcc2].

figure i.1 â€“ an example of location of daas logical components within the layers of the  
cloud computing reference architecture 
figure i.1 shows an example of the location of the daas logical components , which are related to layers in 
the cloud computing reference architecture. 
since the user layer provides the user interface between csc and csp, the daas client logical component can 
be related to this layer in that a daas csc accesses the virtual desktop through this component.  
the capability to provide the connection between d aas cscs and virtual desktops is the main role of the 
connection manager. this daas logical component corresponds to the access layer of the cloud computing 
reference architecture. 
the virtual desktop delivery daas logical component facilitates the implementation of the virtual desktop by 
employing a delivery protocol. therefore, this daas logical component is related to the services layer of the 
cloud computing reference architecture. 
the resource pool and the virtualization infrastructure as daas logical components provide an abstraction of 
software and hardware resources. these two daas logical components are related with the resource and 
network layer of the cloud computing reference architecture.
