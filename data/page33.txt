5 conventions  
in this recommendation: 
the keywords " is required " indicate a requirement which must be strictly followed and from which no 
deviation is permitted if conformance to this document is to be claimed.  
the keywords "is recommended" indicate a requirement which is recommended but which is not absolutely 
required. thus this requirement need not be present to claim conformance. 
the keywords "can optionally" indicate an optional requirement which is permissible, without implying any 
sense of being recommended. this term is not intended to imply that the vendor's implementation must 
provide the option and the feature can be optionally enabled by the network operator/service provider. 
rather, it means the vendor may optionally provide the feature and still claim conformance with the 
specification. 
in the body of thi s document and its appendixes, the words shall, shall not, should and may sometimes 
appear, in which case they are to be interpreted, respectively, as is required to, is prohibited from, is 
recommended and can optionally. the appearance of such phrases or keywords in an appendix or in material 
explicitly marked as informative are to be interpreted as having no normative intent. 
for readability, the short titles are attached to the requirements for referring to use cases in appendix i.

related to the protection of personally identifiable information (pii); 
– security: it is required that the cloud computing systems  provided by the csp  be appropriately 
secured to protect the interests of all involved parties (e.g., persons and organizations);
