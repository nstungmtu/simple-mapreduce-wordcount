• virtual des ktop lifecycle management : it is required that the csp support the full life cycle 
management of the virtual desktop, including set-up, test, delivery, use, maintenance, optimization, 
shutdown and deletion. 
• support of virtual desktop template: in order to achieve better delivery of daas, a desktop template 
can be optionally used for daas maintenance purposes.  
 note 2 – the virtual desktop template includes defining, publishing, verifying, revoking, deleting and other 
related operations. 
• user profile management: it is required that the csp manage the user profile information. 
• server-side platform hardware resource maintenance : it is required that the csp maintain and 
allocate servers, storage, network and related hardware. 
• service-related resource maintenance: it is required that the csp maintain daas service supporting 
applications and data, such as security auditing server, performance monitoring server, active 
directory, database, user configuration, file server, etc. 
• status monitoring: it is rec ommended that the current running status of virtualized resource be 
monitored to perform the change the status requested by a csc. 
• system load monitoring: in order to achieve an appropriate qoe, it is recommended that a csp be 
capable of monitoring the system load to assign virtualized resources to a csc. 
• automated scriptable management interface : it is recommended that the daas management 
solution be accessible through a consistent scripting interface. 
• power management : it can optionally be that the csp is able to suppor t the mechanism that 
monitors server's power and relevant usage in order to perform load balancing or save the power 
consumption in the server. 
• accounting and charging: it is recommended that the csp collect accounting information based on 
computing powe r, network use, storage, memory and/or application licen ce fee. accounting 
information is collected per service and per user. it is also recommended that the csp provide a 
charging scheme based on the accounting information and charging information transparently.  
 note 3 – depending on the implementation of daas, the charging scheme may not be needed. 
• managing and operating pre-configured environments: 
– it is recommended that the csp manage and operate the pre -configured environments which 
are prepared after configuring the service information (such as server processing capacity, the 
prediction of concurrent users and the resources capacity, etc.).  
– it is recommended that the csp provide the preconfigured environment without the loss of user 
functionality and the degradation of performance when service is requested.  
 note 4 – the pre-configured environments are the environmental files such as images of os and applications, 
which reflect the csc's requirements including operating en vironment, installed applications, user data and 
level of service. the pre -configured environments are prepared in advance with the related operations (e.g., 
generating, creating, reproducing and cloning, etc.) and supplied in their use during service exec ution. 
• monitoring and controlling daas: it is recommended to monitor and control the activities of a daas 
platform without impacting the performance of the daas platform.  
 note 5 – a software agent can be used to communicate with a kernel or a hyperviso r in order to create and 
control vms. 
• daas client capability: it is recommended that virtualization infrastructure supports making use of 
any available daas client capability on the csc's device as and when required by application 
programs running in virtual desktop.  
• user log management: it is recommended that the csp keep the connection log information for all 
cscs and their event logs for further security and/or incident analysis.
