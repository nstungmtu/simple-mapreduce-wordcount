7.4.3 client peripheral connection 
the client peripheral connection function: 
– recognizes peripherals on a daas client when they are connected to the daas client; 
– sends a connection request event to a daas platform according to the type of daas client; 
 note 1 – when this function requests the connection of the peripheral, the daas platform executes a device 
driver on a virtual desktop to operate the client peripheral remotely on a daas client. 
– transmits the control events (such as attachment and detachment)  and data for the client 
peripherals to a daas platform through a delivery protocol; 
– disconnects the peripheral on a daas client safely. 
 note 2 – when a daas user  want to disconnect  a peripheral on the assigned virtual desktop, this function 
disconnects the peripheral on the virtual desktop through the removal control event of the peripheral on the 
daas platform. 
7.4.4 service continuity for user environment 
the service continuity for user environment function provides a daas client with a reconnection to provide 
for the continuity of service against the network failure or any faults of a daas platform. this function: 
– requests a reconnection to the client connection management function (see clause 7.2.2) in case of 
a connection failure in order to maintain continuous virtual desktop service; 
– reconnects a virtual desktop running on a daas client with an available daas platform; 
– saves the daas user states of the virtual desktop on the daas client; 
 note – the daas user state includes data, working environments for a daas user, etc. 
– synchronizes the saved user states of the virtual desktop on the daas client with user states of the 
virtual desktop on the daas platform when the daas client is reconnected to the daas platform.
