7.1.3 virtual machine operation and control 
vm operation and control are referred to the management of physical or virtual computing resources that 
allow users to create, edit, start and stop vms. 
the impetus behind cloud computing is the ever -increasing demand to manage growth and increase 
computing flexibility by dynamic resource operation and control based on demand. an example of resource 
control operation could be to horizontally scale a database server by migrating it from a small cpu resource 
configuration to an extra -large cpu resource to improv e throughput. this basic requirement of cloud 
computing is supported by the resource operation and control system. an inefficient resource operation and 
control system has a direct negative effect on performance. it can also indirectly affect system functionality. 
some system functions provided might become ineffective due to poor performance.
