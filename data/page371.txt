− architecture: the standard which provides reference architecture; 
− api, interface, profile: the standard which provides common interface, api and/or its profile; 
− data model, format, schema: the standard which provides data model or protocol including scheme 
and/or its encoding format; 
− others (e.g., guidelines, technical reports). 
the vertical axis describes the related technologies for supporting big data as follows. 
− fundamental: concept of big data and its applications; 
− data exchange: for supporting big data publishing, sharing, transaction, etc.; 
− data integration: with heterogeneous data sources; 
− analysis/visualization: for mining model description, etc.; 
− data provenance/metadata: for data quality, history tracking, data management, etc.; 
− security/privacy: for big data, especially personal identification information; 
− other: big data related technologies which are not described above. 
note 1 – the items on the horizontal axis are not subordinated to the different technologies.  
note 2 – the items on the vertical axis can be modified with technology change. 
note 3 – a standard has more than one location on the matrix. in the case that one standard is included in 
multiple document categories (horizontal axis) or related technologies (vertical axis), it can be mapped 
several times. 
table 10-1 shows the standardization matrix related to big data.
