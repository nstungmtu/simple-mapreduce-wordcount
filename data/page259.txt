table ii.6 – high mobility support on distributed cloud 
use case 
name high mobility support on distributed cloud. 
abstract this use case illustrates an example of high mobility support on distributed cloud.  
a typical mobility support environment follows a method of modifying the packet routing path 
while the location of the service is fixed. on the distributed cloud, the location of the service is 
different from the conventional cloud and is located near the user. accordingly, the distributed 
cloud needs high mobility. 
as an example, the below figure shows two ways of mobility while an end device moves with 
different type of access. one way is that the regional cloud routes the packet to the previous 
edge cloud as shown in step 3 in the figure below. (it is also possible to route the cloud service 
to the current edge cloud.) another way is that the core cloud routes the cloud service to the 
edge cloud near the end device by scaling or migrating the cloud service with hig h-speed and 
reliable network connectivity as shown in step 5 and 6. the cloud service is from the previous 
edge cloud or the core cloud. therefore, to efficiently support high mobility on the distributed 
cloud, both ways are selected based on service level agreement (sla) for the cloud service. sla 
includes latency, quality of service, etc.
