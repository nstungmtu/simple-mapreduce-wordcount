overview and reference model for storage in a cloud environment 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
storage resources are used to store a huge amount of data. the traditional storage system utilizes a tightly-
coupled symmetry reference model which aims to work out high performance computing problems and may 
fulfil cloud computing scalability requirements . the next generation system adopts a loosely -coupled 
asymmetry reference model which centralizes metadata and controls manipulation. this reference model is 
not suitable for high performance computing; however, this design is to solve large capacity storag e needs 
based on cloud computing deployment. 
the applications and data in cloud environments need be delivered and maintained reliably using a tightly-
coupled architecture. other applications (e.g., search engines, media streaming) may rely on loosely-coupled 
architecture. 
i.1 reference model for cloud storage 
cloud storage delivers virtualized storage on demand over a network based on cluster, grid and distributed 
file systems. when the key issue of operation and processing in cloud computing i s the storage and 
management of large-scale data, a large number of storage equipment need to be deployed. hence, cloud 
storage is a cloud computing system for data storage and management. 
figure i.1 depicts the cloud storage reference model.
