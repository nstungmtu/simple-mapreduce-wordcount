6 overview 
a software as a s ervice (saas) application environment is a service -oriented multi -tenant development, 
deployment and execution environment in which software and its associated data are hosted centrally and 
are typically accessed on-demand by users using a client, e.g., a web browser, over the internet. 
while this recommendation is primarily concerned with saas, some of the concepts in this recommendation 
may also be applicable to other cloud service categories that also include the application capabilities type, 
for example communications as a service (caas). 
figure 1 depicts a conceptual model of a saas application environment. the underlying capabi lities from 
infrastructure as a service (iaas), platform as a service (paas) and desktop as a service  (daas) will be 
encapsulated into services and provide consistent secure access using exported service access point (sap). in 
this recommendation, iaas could provide computing services, storage services and network services; paas 
could provide platform service, and daas could provide desktop service for a saas application environment. 
all these services constitute the basic building blocks of an application development. 
the environment also provides some necessary service management functions including service registration, 
service configuration, service orchestration, service dependency checking, service access control, service 
isolation, service monitoring and other service control functions.
