6 overview of cloud storage in visual surveillance 
the large -scale deployment of  visual surveillance systems has contributed to the explosive growth of 
surveillance video data. it induces stringen t needs for the  efficient storage of massive video data and fast 
access of information of interest to users. cloud storage is a data storage model for enabling service users to 
have ubiquitous, convenient and on -demand network access to a shared pool of co nfigurable storage 
resources, which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service -
provider interaction. in the cloud storage system, the physical and virtual resources can be dynamically 
assigned and reassigned according to the users' demands. 
7 functional architecture for cloud storage in visual surveillance 
7.1 architectural framework 
figure 7-1 shows the architectural framework for cloud storage in visual surveillance. the cloud storage based 
visual surveillance platform consists of two parts, which are respectively the traditional visual surveillance 
(vs) system and the cloud storage system. the cloud storage system can also be integrated with intelligent 
visual surveillance, mobile visual surveillance and other visual surveillance subsystems and the architecture 
is similar to that defined in this clause and is not described in this recommendation.
