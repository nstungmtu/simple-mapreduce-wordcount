facebook server fan 
speed control interface 
draft v0.1 [b-ocp fsci] 
this document describes facebook's fsc algorithm 
and its update methodology. using the openipmi 
fan speed control (fsc) is an intelligent method for 
controlling server fans to provide adequate cooling 
while managing thermal constraints and power 
efficiency. this document will help to manage fsc 
settings and fsc updates by using intelligent 
platform management interface (ipmi) commands 
to vary the fan control profile on either local or 
remote systems.
