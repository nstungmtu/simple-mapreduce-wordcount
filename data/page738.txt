summary 
recommendation itu-t x.1602 analyses the maturity levels of software as a service (saas) application and 
proposes security requirements to provide a consistent and sec ure service execution environment for saas 
applications. these proposed requirements originate from cloud service providers (csp) and cloud service 
partners (csn) as they need a saas application environment to meet their demands on security. the 
requirements are general and independent of any service or scenario specific model (e.g., web services, or 
representational state transfer (rest)), assumptions or solutions.
