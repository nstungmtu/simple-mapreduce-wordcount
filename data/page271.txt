8 requirements for networking resources 
typically, there are several types of networks involved in cloud computing services delivery and composition, 
such as the intra-datacentre network and inter-datacentre network, as well as the access and core transport 
network, etc. 
to illustrate the cloud computing network concepts described in this recommendation, a generic network 
model, which supports cloud computing infrastructure, is shown in figure 8-1.

figure 8-1 â€“ generic network model for cloud infrastructure 
the generic network model shown in figure 8-1 consists of the following blocks: 
1) intra-datacentre network : the network connecting local cloud infrastructures, such as the 
datacentre local area network used to connect servers, storage arrays and l4 -l7 devices 
(e.g., firewalls, load balancers, application acceleration devices). 
2) access and core transport network : t he network used by cscs to access and consume cloud 
services deployed by the csp.
