use cases of cloud computing  
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this appendix identifies use cases of cloud computing. table i.1 shows the template used for the description 
of the use cases. 
table i.1 – template for the description of a use case 
use case 
name title of the use case  
abstract overview and features of the use case 
roles roles relating to/appearing in the use case 
figure figure to present the use case.  
(a uml-like diagram is suggested for clarifying relations between roles)  
pre-conditions 
(optional) 
pre-conditions represent the necessary conditions or use cases that should be achieved 
before starting the described use case.  
note – as dependency may exist among different use cases, pre-conditions and post-
conditions are introduced to help understand the relationships among use cases. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
as for pre-conditions, the post-condition describes conditions or use cases that will be 
carried out after the termination of a currently described use case.  
requirements the title of requirements derived from the use case. for example: 
– large-scale migration 
table i.2 lists the use cases described in this appendix.
