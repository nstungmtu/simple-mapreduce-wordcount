use case 
pre-conditions 
(optional) 
– ① the csc has accessed the iaas service through the csp portal with an appropriate 
security mechanism. 
– ② the csc has selected the template or configured a specific vm and/or physical host.  
– ② the csc has selected the storage resources, such as block, file and object storage, 
then attached them via their computing capabilities or used them directly.  
– ② the csc has selected the network connectivity services, such as the ip address, vlan, 
firewall and load balance and then applied them to the related computing and/or 
storage capabilities. 
– ② the csc confirmed the slas and charge model with selected computing, sto rage and 
network connectivity services provided by the csp. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
– ③ the csc manages and monitors computing, storage and network capabilities with 
arbitrary applications. 
– ③ the csp configures, deploys and maintains hypervisors and storage resources. 
– ③ the csp establishes, configures, delivers and maintains network connectivity to the 
csc. 
– ③ the csp provides security infrastructure to the csc. 
requirements – configuration, deployment and maintenance of resources 
– use and monitoring of resources

use case 
name naas general use case 
abstract a naas csp sets up, maintains and releases the network connectivity between cscs and 
between the csp and csc as a cloud service. this can include on -demand and semi-
permanent connectivity.

pre-conditions 
(optional) 
– there is no connectivity between xaas csc a and xaas csp y. 
– there is no connectivity between xaas csp x and xaas csp y.  
– either xaas csc a or xaas csp y requests the connectivity between them with their end -
point identifiers and associated characteristics (referring to qos and security aspects) 
for the connectivity. 
– either xaas csp x or xaas csp y requests the connectivity between them with their end -
point identifiers and associated characteristics (referring to qos and security aspects) 
for the connectivity. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
– xaas csc a and xaas csp y can communicate with each other. 
– xaas csc x and xaas csp y can communicate with each other.
