– gathers information on the platform power consumption or utilization accordi ng to the weighted 
resource usage from the power management function (see clause 7.3.6); 
 note 7 – the weighted resource usage mean which resources are heavily used as usual ; the platform power 
consumption is estimated by the sum of these usages. 
– performs the scheduling from the policies about a daas user's usage pattern and power 
consumption in virtualization infrastructure; 
– sends a policy to the allocation function (see clause 7.2.4) to select the virtualization infrastructure 
to operate a virtual desktop; 
– establishes a backup policy which covers types and frequency of backing up the virtual desktop  
enviorment to prepare for a system disaster; 
– provides user interfaces for established policies which are established and applied dynamically or 
manually by the administrator. 
7.3.5 high availability for daas 
for high availability, daas adopts platform c lustering which includes connection manger and virtualization 
infrastructure to maintain the seamless daas user's connection in a failure occurrence sit uation. the high 
availability for daas function: 
– detects a system failure by confirming states among daas platforms; 
– ensures daas users have a stable running environment in terms of delivery and operation of virtual 
desktops; 
– sets up the redundancy for the client connection management function (see clause 7.2.2) to perform 
failover with minimum downtime and connection continuity; 
 note 1 – the redundancy for the client connection management function ( see clause 7.2.2) includes the 
duplication by active-active form or active-standby form. in order not to lose the daas user's connection, csu's 
account and access information (such as db, license or active directory) are duplicated or mirrored. 
– configures the failover to redundancy for virtualization infrastructure; 
 note 2 – the redundancy for virtualizatio n infrastructure (such as the redundant server on active state for 
virtual desktop environments) is configured to perform failover for minimizing downtime. it helps to allocate 
a virtual desktop by load balancing or migrating a virtual desktop to the activated server to a daas client when 
the failure occurs on the server to which the virtual desktop is allocated, by providing a service without the 
loss of the user environment. 
– saves the user's environment during a certain time and backs up and restores it on a local disk or on 
shared storage, thus preventing the loss of the user environment. 
7.3.6 power management of virtual desktop resource 
the power management of virtual desktop resources function manages the power consumpt ion of a daas 
platform with virtual desktop resources. this function: 
– monitors the power consumption and the related performance factors of a virtual desktop and each 
resource in a daas platform; 
– calculates the variation of power consumption and performance of a  virtual desktop or a  daas 
platform by collecting monitoring information; 
– supports other functions for the provisioning and allocation of virtu al desktop function 
(see clause 7.2.4) or the operational policy management for daas function (see clause 7.3.4).
