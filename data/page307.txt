use case 
use case title inter-cloud use case: performance guarantee against an abrupt increase in load 
relevant roles csp and csc 
use case description – a csp guarantees its service performance, even when an unexpected surge 
in access to the service arises, by using cloud resources provided by other 
csps on a temporary basis.  
– when overload is detected at a csp, available resources in other csps are 
autonomously discovered and reserved through the inter-cloud federation. 
– network connections among interworking csps are instantaneously 
established or reconfigured. then service-related data including user 
identifier (id), user data and application data are transferred from the 
original csp to the csp that is leasing the resources. 
– access from cscs is appropriately changed to the interworking csps so as to 
distribute the load and thus mitigate the overload of the original csp.  
information flow  – relevant csps are supposed to join a common trusted alliance (i.e., 
federation) in advance and set up the service level agreements (slas).  
– a csp inquires about the resource availability of other csps in the federation 
and requests reservation of the available resources that meet the quality 
requirements of the csc. the requested csps reply whether or not they are 
able to lease the requested resources. 
– the cloud resource management (e.g., crud: create, read, update and 
delete) are operated across multiple csps. the management is to enable 
cloud resources to be leased from different csps in the federation.  
– the relevant csps exchange monitoring and auditing information of the 
leased resources.
