 framework and requirements for cloud computing 1 
 
   239 
– agile service: it is recommended that a distributed cloud provide rapid development and delivery of 
cloud services to distributed cloud resources to support various csc's requests; 
– automatic service displacement: it is recommended that a distributed cloud provide cloud service 
displacement to deploy, maintain and upgrade automatically based on slas; 
– autonomous cloud service provisioning : it is required a distributed cloud provide autonomous 
cloud service provisioning to initially launch the cloud s ervice by using context information for fast 
provisioning of distributed cloud resources; 
 note 5 – autonomous cloud service provisioning  refers to deploying and providing cloud services on edge 
clouds without intervention of global management in the core cloud by using context information in edge or 
regional clouds. 
– massive data handling on edge cloud: it is recommended that a distributed cloud provide massive 
data handling on edge clouds to reduce the interaction between core/regional clouds and edge 
clouds. 
 note 6 – data handling on edge clouds includes filtering and delivery process to prevent noise from multiple 
end devices, and batched data delivery to core or regional clouds, respectively.  
7.4 management requirements for distributed cloud 
– global management: it is required that a distributed cloud provide global management of 
distributed cloud resources collected from core, regional and edge clouds; 
 note 1 – core cloud aggregates information of distributed cloud resources, has global knowledge and  
provides cloud services appropriately to meet csc's requirements. 
– real-time service management: it is required that a distributed cloud provide management for real-
time cloud services by finding feasible distributed cloud resources, predicting cloud service latency 
and scheduling cloud services; 
– heterogeneous resource management: it is required that a distributed cloud provide management 
of heterogeneous distributed cloud resources to accommodate and utilize distributed cloud 
resources easily and efficiently; 
 note 2 – examples of heterogeneous distributed cloud resources includes different capacity servers, different 
types (block, object, file) of storages and different speeds of network devices.  
– end-device connectivity management: it is required that a distributed cloud provide management 
of network connectivity to end devices supporting various access protocols to control network 
latency and bandwidth; 
– context information management: it is required that a distributed cloud provide management of 
context information to support service routing and context awareness of the distributed cloud; 
– synchronization management : it is required that a distributed cloud provide synchronization 
management for the status of cloud services and distr ibuted cloud resources to perform global 
management accurately. 
7.5 security requirements for distributed cloud 
– resource isolation and protection: it is recommended that a distributed cloud provide isolation and 
protection of distributed cloud resources and cloud services for tenants to guarantee security; 
– adaptive security function control : it is recommended that a distributed cloud provide adaptive 
security functions to meet a csc's requirements with different resource capacity among core, 
regional and edge clouds; 
 note 1 – examples of security function include encryption, decryption, key management, authentication and 
policy management. 
– adaptive security suites control : it is recommended that a distributed cloud provide adaptive 
security suites to apply the suites on different resource capacities among core, regional and edge 
clouds. 
 note 2 – examples of security suites in case of encryption include data encryption standard (des), advanced 
encryption standard (aes), international data encryption algorithm (idea) and rivest, shamir, adleman (rsa).
