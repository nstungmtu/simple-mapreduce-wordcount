the modular hypervisors partly controlled by the csc functionalities are built upon elements as follows: 
– user domain manager: responsible for building and managing the per -user administrative domain 
and user domains for each user; 
– system domain manager : responsible for building and managing the system -wide administrative 
domain. 
the secure enclave based on hardware security mechanisms functionalities are built upon elements as 
follows: 
– secure enclave library : responsible for implementing encrypted net working using transport layer 
security (tls) (e.g., using a standard tls library), encrypted and sealed storage, attestation, and 
inter-process communication. these are features that are exposed to the application code. cloud 
service developers use these secure primitives to write their secure cloud service. 
– discrete security chips coupled with processor features : responsible for providing the necessary 
underlying capabilities to implement secure enclave. 
the sso authentication functionalities are built upon elements as follows: 
– user request handler : responsible for accepting the identity information provided by the cloud 
service user and forwarding this information to the identity management system; 
– identity management system: responsible for authenticating csc requests and sharing the result of 
this authentication to inter -cloud members. it is also responsible for managing the identity 
information of its associated inter-cloud members.
