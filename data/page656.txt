7.3 network service functional requirements 
– it is recommended that iaas csp provides network functions, such as ip address, vlan, virtual 
switch, load balance, firewall, with specific slas or charging model. network functions are applied 
to access and interconnect of processing and storage resources. 
– it is recommended that iaas csp provides network information in response to queries from the csc.  
 note – the information include s, but not limited to , network device(s) specification, network traffic 
performance (in terms of throughput, jitter, loss, delay) and network topology.  
7.3.1 network policy migration 
– it is recommended that iaas csp  provides network policy migration along with virtual machine  
migration. in that case, the network policy of the migrated virtual machine is the same as before the 
migration. 
7.3.2 network qos 
– it is recommended that iaas csp provides operation handling mecha nisms related to the network 
quality of service (qos), such as bandwidth limit, bandwidth reservation, traffic shaping, traffic 
classification, congestion avoidance, at port level, device level and network level. 
7.3.3 ip address 
– it is recommended that iaas csp provides ip address reservation.  
 note – csp reserves a pool of public ip addresses or a segment of private ip addresses for the csc. 
– it is required that iaas csp allows the csc to apply, bind , unbind, query, release an ip address to 
processing resources or storage resources. 
– it is recommended that iaas csp allows the csc to allocate ip addresses to provisioned processing 
resources or storage resources with dynamic or static method.  
– iaas csp can optionally provide network address translation (nat). 
7.3.4 network isolation  
– it is required that iaas csp provides the csc with isolated tenants' networks. 
– it is recommended that iaas csp provides the csc with operations handling mechanisms related to 
isolated tenants' networks, such as create, query and release. 
7.3.5 virtual networking 
– it is recommended that iaas csp manages virtual networking to provide network connectivity 
amongst various processing and storage resources. 
7.3.6 load balance 
– it is recommended that iaas csp optimize s infrastructure resources utilization by providing lo ad 
balance related functions, such as throughput, response time, to avoid overload of any one of the 
infrastructure resources.  
– iaas csp can optionally provide multipath routing to achieve an optimized traffic management (e.g., 
to improve network utilization, to guarantee qos at network congestion or fault). 
7.3.7 firewall 
– it is recommended that iaas csp delivers physical or virtual firewall to the csc. 
7.3.8 gateway 
– it is recommended that iaas csp provides necessary network interworking functions so that the csc 
uses provisioned infrastructure resources as if they are at the csc's premises.
