 framework and requirements for cloud computing 1 
 
   267 
the resources abstraction and control requirements include: 
• it is recommended that abstracted resources can be accessed and provisioned in a unified manner. 
• it is recommended that abstracted resources are discovered, used and released through unified 
interfaces. 
• it is recommended that abstracted resources are deployed and provisioned based on pre -defined 
policies. 
• it is required to provide life -cycle management of resource templates (e.g., resource template 
creation, publication, activation, revocation and deletion). 
• a resource template can optionally be applied to a group of resources at the same time. 
• it is required to support monitoring of all physical and virtual resources. 
• it is recommended that resource monitoring is capable of detecting the failures of resources. 
11 support of emergency telecommunications 
under emergency telecommunications (et) [b -itu-t y.2205], any emergency -related service is understood 
as requiring special handling relative to other services. 
if any component in the cloud infrastructure is used to support an emergency telecommunications service 
(ets), the requirements in [b-itu-t y.1271] are relevant. 
12 security considerations 
it is recommended that the security requirements of [b-itu-t y.2201], [b-itu-t y.2701] and the applicable x, 
y and m series of itu-t security recommendations be taken into consideration; this includes access control, 
authentication, data confidentiality, communications security, data integrity, availability and privacy. 
security aspects for consideration within cloud computing environment are addressed by security challenges 
for csps, as described in [itu-t x.1601]. in particular, [itu-t x.1601] analyses security threats and challenges 
and describes security capabilities that could mitigate these threats and meet security challenges.
