table i.9 – data regulation across different countries in the inter-cloud environment 
title data regulation across different countries in the inter-cloud environment 
description with the development of industrial globalization, data movement across 
geographical borders in the inter-cloud environment is increasingly frequent. 
however, data movement regulation varies significantly in different counties in 
several aspects, e.g., data ownership, privacy protection, law application and 
jurisdiction, as well as international trade rules. therefore, the csp needs to 
identify the various data movement regulations once data needs to flow across 
geographical borders and provide the solution, if necessary and possible.  
for example, when the csc requests saas service requiring datasets located 
separately in country a and country b, csp-a acts in an inter-cloud federation 
pattern among csps and becomes the contact point for the csc. csp -a needs to 
monitor the validity of the data movement regulation of country b and 
negotiate between country a and country b, if necessary and possible.

pre-conditions (optional) the csps form an inter-cloud federation pattern. 
the data needs to flow across borders of countries that have different data 
movement regulations.

derived requirements data movement regulation across geographical borders (see clause 8.2)
