5 intercloud and interoperability  
 
872  
– the controllability of the information associated with the primary csp role can be transferred 
to the secondary csps with minimum interruptions; 
– a csp is able to cancel the permission transfer arrangements. 
• inter-cloud service handling should be confirmed as follows: 
– service intermediation is supported; 
– service aggregation is supported; 
– service arbitrage is supported. 
a csp can make use of one or more cloud services which are provided by other csp. in every patterns of 
inter-cloud, there ar e two roles of csp – primary csp and secondary csp. the provider making use of the 
services is termed a primary csp while a provider whose services are being used is termed a secondary csp.  
there are two types of relationship between a primary csp and a secondary csp: 
• the use of secondary csp's cloud services by a primary csp; 
• the use of secondary csp 's business and administration capabilities by the primary csp 's cloud 
service operations manager and csp's cloud service manager to establish and control the use of the 
secondary csp's cloud services. 
based on the reference architecture, the interworking involved in csp -csp relationship and corresponding 
test objectives can be identified as follows: 
• interworking between primary csp and csc 
test objective is to verify that csc can use cloud service, administer use of cloud service and perform 
business administration to the cloud services, in peering, federation or intermediary pattern; 
• interworking between primary csp's peer service integration component and secondary csp 
test objective is to verify that primary csp can connect to services of secondary csp with appropriate 
security and with appropriate accounting for the usage;   
• interworking between primary csp's peer service management component and secondary csp 
test objective is to verify that the primary csp's operational support systems and business support 
systems can be connected to the administration capabilities and business capabilities of secondary 
csp; 
• interworking between csps to form and maintain inter-cloud pattern 
test objective is to verify that multiple csp can interact to form and maintain the peering, federation 
or intermediary pattern. 
8 cloud computing interoperability testing between csp and its management system 
the interface of management system is used to interact with cloud ser vices to provide supporting 
capabilities, such as monitoring and provisioning of cloud service. as described in [itu-t y.3502 ], 
management functional components are implemented in multi -layer functions in reference architecture. 
interoperability testing is done to verify the following test objective: 
• operational support test 
test objective is to verify that csp can perform oss related operation that required managi ng and 
controlling the cloud services offered to csc, including runtime administration, monitoring, 
provisioning and maintenance. 
• business support test 
test objective is to verify that csp can provide a set of business -related management capabilities 
dealing with customers and supporting processes, including product catalogue, billing and financial 
management.
