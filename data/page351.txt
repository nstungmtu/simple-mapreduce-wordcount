table ii.1 – continuous product improvement 
title continuous product improvement 
description a software game manufacturing company would like to concentrate on application 
development as a basic activity and the area of investment. in order to continuously 
improve its products, the company needs an analytics solution to collect and analyse the 
associated market and users' feedback. the company embedded monitoring functions in 
the software games to observe users' behaviours, activities and preferences of available 
game options. in addition a questionnaire is included in the game application for obtaining 
offline users' feedback. other sources of information about the game perception are 
internet forums, discussion lists and social communities, as well as press and television 
publications. given the large number of game users, the company has a lot of information 
to sift through every month. but the amount of data can change depending on the schedule 
of new games publication, so proper planning and smart organization of feedba ck data 
analysis would help the company's it team in their use of big data analytics to improve 
business success.  
the game company builds an analytical solution based on big data as a service (bdaas) by 
defining: 
– the schedule of bdaas activity depending on games publication time; 
– requirements for data collection directly from the application using embedded 
monitoring functions; 
– requirements for collection of internet and press data related to the game in order to 
analyse users' and market opinions and its evolution; 
– requirements for social media data analysis of game users' opinions and direct exchange 
between users; 
– the access method to the user generated questionnaire data about the game;  
– database selection for all data collected about the game; 
– requirements for analytics and reporting to emphasize the opinions about the 
application, identify strong and weak points, gaps and spare elements;  
– monitoring criteria to analyse the intensity of new opinions on appearance generated 
by users to identify the application maturity level, which allows decisions to be made 
about ending involvement in the product; 
– performance objectives to be reached by the bdaas system. 
the game company orders a bdaas including the following elements:  
– specification of data sources, which need to be serviced; 
– data integration goals for overall analytics; 
– database functionalities; 
– data storage functionalities (data types, variety, lifetime); 
– analytical tool functionalities; 
– access to analytical tool configuration and customization; 
– reporting schemes and integration with the company internal systems;  
– data collected and results of analysis available only for the company, even if publicly 
available data are used. 
roles/sub-roles – the cloud service provider should support the csp:bdip role to collect, process, store 
and delete data according to the csc (i.e., the game manufacturing company) 
specifications. in addition, the csp should support the csp:bdap role to provide 
analytical applications with integration of csc systems, as well as reporting solutions.
