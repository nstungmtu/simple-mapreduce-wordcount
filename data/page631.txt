note – virtual router (vrouter) can also be applicable to naas connectivity.  
pre-conditions 
(optional) 
– there is connectivity between xaas csc a and xaas csp y. 
– there is connectivity between xaas csp x and xaas csp y. 
– either the xaas csp or the csc requests a network application (vfw, vcdn, vdpi, 
vrouter etc.) to be chained with the connectivity. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
– naas csp offers network applications for the xaas csc/csp over existing network 
connectivity. 
derived requirements – on-demand virtual network application 
– scalable network application 
– chain of network applications  
– qos-guaranteed applications 
– secure network applications 
– resilient network applications 
– multiple ip addresses (refer to clause 7.4) 
note – the first six requirements belong to general requirements of naas which are 
provided in [itu-t y.3501]. 
ii.2.1.2 naas application use case for application provision 
 
title naas application use case for application provision 
description assume that company csc-b looks for naas application services to benefit from key 
characteristics of the cloud computing services. as an example, the company wants to 
accelerate network traffic saturated with business applications. wide area network (wan) 
optimization is very crucial for the success of its business applications. csc-b wants usage-
based deployment of wan optimizations and flexible feature support on -demand. 
traditional wan optimization appliance devices cannot fulfil those requirements, in 
particular, in terms of total cost of ownership and deployment elasticity. 
naas csp needs to provide virtual wan acceleration solution to csc-b, coping with its 
dynamic business needs.
