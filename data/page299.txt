8.3 overview of inter-cloud intermediary 
8.3.1 introduction 
the inter-cloud intermediary pattern provides the capability for csps to offer additional services to the cscs 
and to other csps. 
as shown in figure 8 -7, one of the central components of the inter -cloud intermediary pattern is the 
catalogue of service offerings. this csp's catalogue is a registry that includes the services that the csp offers 
to cscs and to other csps. the catalogue provides the capability for cscs and csps to obtain services from 
the csp offering the services. this catalogue may be accessible through a portal and/or via a well -defined 
interface or api.

in addition to the catalogue of service offerings, the csp can include functions for the support of service 
intermediation, service aggregation and service arbitrage as described in clause 7.3. 
8.3.2 primary csp and secondary csp 
the csp that is responsible for offering the service to the csc is the primary csp. the csps that support the 
primary csp by offering their services are the secondary csps. 
in an inter-cloud intermediary pattern (see figure 8-8), services listed in the primary csp catalogue of service 
offerings may include the services hosted by the primary csp itself or services that are provided by secondary 
csps. in most cases, the primary csp catalogue of service offerings will be a combination of services hosted 
by the primary csp and services offered by the secondary csps.
