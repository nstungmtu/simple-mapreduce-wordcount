framework and requirements for cloud computing 1 
 
   179 
for the physical machine, [itu-t y.3510] defines three requirements as follows. 
– it is recommended to support hardware resource virtualization. 
– it is recommended to support horizontal scalability (e.g. , adding more computing machines) and 
vertical scalability (e.g., adding more resources with a computing machine). 
– it is recommended to use power optimization solutions to reduce energy consumption. 
it is inferred from the requirements that the physical machine supports scalable resources with consideration 
of energy consumption.  
figure 6-1 shows the conceptual diagram of a computing machine in [itu-t y.3510].

a virtual machine provides virtualized resource pools using virtualization technologies specific to physical 
resource types like cpu, memory, i/o and network from a physical machine. the virtual machine also covers 
management issues. 
since all cloud services have to reside and operate on physical machines, it is important for the cloud service 
providers and especially for the infrastructure as a service (iaas) cloud service provider (csp) who will build 
the cloud infrastructure, as well as for the manufacturer who will sell the cloud infrastructure, to identify 
specific requirements of the physical machine. 
6.2 introduction to the physical machine 
the physical machine is a type of computing machine in which the c loud services must reside and operate  
and that provides physical resources, such as processing, storage, networking, etc.
