abstract service offering models for inter-cloud computing 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this appendix describes several abstract service offering models relevant to inter -cloud computing and 
provides supplementary information to the description provided in the main body of the recommendation. 
inter-cloud computing performed over multiple csps allows a csp (i.e., the primary csp) to offer new services 
with respect to expanded service items (cf. clause iii.1) and enhanced service operations (cf. clause iii.2).  
iii.1 service item expansion 
in terms of service variety, there are roughly two types of cloud expansions; one refers to adding more of the 
same resources that the primary csp already has, and the other refers to adding features based on the 
resources that differ from those the primary csp has.  
figure iii.1 shows these two expansions.

b) v olume expansion –
more than two units are offered beyond primary capacity.
a) basic model –
two units are offered to a user.
c) service variety expansion –
v arious units are offered beyond primary capability.
 
figure iii.1 – service item expansion – volume and variety expansions in inter-cloud computing 
in the basic model shown in figure iii.1 -a, a single csp offers a service consisting of two resource units. a 
typical example of such a resource is a virtual machine (vm). the csp by itself offers two vms to a given csc.  
in the volume expansion shown in f igure iii.1-b, two additional vms are provided by the secondary csps a 
and b. with their support, the primary csp can offer a volume-expanded service, which now consists of four 
vms.
