title distributed information exchange system in trusted inter-cloud  
– the csc requests that physical location (localization) for their data store as 
well as csp can be chosen by csc in an elastic manner. 
– the primary csp(saas) in an inter-cloud intermediary pattern (acts as 
csp(intermediary)) is the contact point for csc. 
– the csp(intermediary) integrates and validate saas services from multiple 
csps (secondary csps). 
– the csp2(saas) offers the same service as csp1(saas) or csp3(saas) but does 
not meet the required business regulatory policy. 
– for the csp(intermediary), in order to respect the  request of csc, it is 
necessary to validate security and confidentiality policies from secondary 
csp1(saas), csp2(saas) and csp3(saas). in case of negative validation, the 
secondary csp offer is not presented to csc. 
– in case of connectivity problem between csp(intermediary) and csp1, the 
saas service is automatically established between csp(intermediary) and 
csp3. 
in particular, an example of such service could be paas-based processing of 
satellite image data for farm crop analysis.

pre-conditions (optional) – the primary csp(saas) and secondary csps are in a trusted inter-cloud 
relationship. 
– the csp1(saas) and csp3(saas) effects security, safety and confidentiality 
policies. 
– the csp2(saas) performs service out of business regulatory policy.  
post-conditions (optional) – the csp(intermediary) guarantees the security and confidentiality policy of 
saas.  
– the csp(intermediary) establishes service between csc and csp1(saas). 
– the csp(intermediary) establishes service between csc and csp3(saas) in case 
of failed csp1(saas). 
derived requirements – security and confidentiality policies  
– master service agreements 
– on-demand data security services  
– deployment and monitoring of security policies around csps  
– respect data regulation policy (e.g., medical, financial, defence, etc.)  
 note – regulation policy concern regulation applied to particular business.  
– respect business regulatory policies 
– resiliency service  
– respect laws and regulations,  
– respect local policies.
