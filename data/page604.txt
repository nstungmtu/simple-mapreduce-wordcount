uses i_ccm_uapm to refer to csc types and profiles from the uapm-f. a resource request/cancellation is 
delivered by i_sc_ccm and transferred to pa -f thorough i_ccm_pa. additionally, the ccm-f receives the 
client connection state from the sc -f through i_sc_ccm to monitor virtual desktop connection and 
reconnection requests from the scue-f through i_scue_ccm against network failure. a detailed functional 
description for the ccm-f is specified in clause 7.2.2. 
9.2.4 provisioning and allocation of virtual desktop function 
in order to configure the pre-configured virtual desktop environment or create new virtual desktops, the pa-
f uses i_pa_pm, i_pa_opm, and i_pa_uapm to get power performance information, policies, and csu's 
account information, respectively. after configuration of a virtual desktop, the pa -f allocat es the virtual 
desktop using vi-fs through i_pa_iam. the pa -f also synchronizes the daas user's state with the scue -f 
through i_scue_pa. detailed functional description for the pa-f is specified in clause 7.2.4. 
9.3 virtual desktop resource management functions 
the vdrm-fs are composed of monitoring and controlling virtual desktop resource function (mc-f), uapm-
f, virtual desktop resource allocation and distribution function (rad-f) and operational policy management 
for daas function (opm -f). vdrm -fs also i ncludes high availability for daas function (ha -f) and power 
management of virtual desktop resource function (pm-f) for more effective management. figure 9-3 shows 
vdrm-fs with two interconnections of vdcd-fs and vi-fs.

9.3.1 monitoring and controlling virtual desktop resource 
the mc -f has the connection with virtualization infrastructure through i_iam_mc to receive monitoring 
information or send the control commands from or to the infrastructure access management function (iam-
f). the mc-f is connected with the ha-f through i_mc_ha and with the opm-f through i_opm_pm for the 
resource state. the mc-f also sends monitoring information of resources and resource usages to the pm-f 
and rad -f with i_mc_pm and i_opm_mc , r espectively. detailed functional description for the mc -f is 
specified in clause 7.3.1.
