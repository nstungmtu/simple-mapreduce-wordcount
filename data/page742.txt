in the industry , the maturity of saas is classified into four levels which could be shortly named as custom 
level, configurable level, multi -tenant level, and scalable level. each level covers  characteristics of the 
previous one and provides extended characteristics. the diagram that represents the characteristics of the

different maturity levels of the saas application have different security requirements to saas application 
environments, and the requirements will be illustrated from the viewpoint of csps and csns in clause 8. 
7.1 level 1: custom saas application 
custom saas application is similar to the traditional application service provider  (asp) model of software 
delivery. each customer has its own customized solution for saas application and run s its indivi dual 
application instance on the cloud server. as illustrated in figure 2, the custom application instance comprises 
the whole execution environment including the operating system (os), the data management system and 
the middleware that are specific to each tenant, and the saas environment provider has to maintain multiple 
instances. this model is difficult to scale in order to satisfy the increasing requirement demands of customers, 
and it can be costly to operate.
