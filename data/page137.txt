i.6 data virtualization csp:sfp 
title data virtualization by csp:sfp 
description this scenario shows data virtualizations through the description of read and write data. dsf 
service customer #1 writes a file through the dsf service. dsf service provider prepares to 
write data because file a, shown in figure 1, is saved on a single virtual volume. as the 
preparation information (e.g., owner, policies and corresponding apis of data storage, etc.), 
data operation metadata for the file a is generated. the file a namely data a, is saved and 
managed by the data operation metadata, such as number of data portioning, data location, 
etc. in this procedure, the file a was abstracted for data provisioning and management by 
policies.   
dsf service customer #1 reads a file through the dsf service. dsf service provider gathers data 
based on the data operation metadata. dsf service provider aggregates partitions of data and 
then data is provided to dsf service customer #1. it is possible for the provided data to be 
used again. therefore, the data is cached and reflected on data operation metadata. for t his 
reason, dsf service customer #2 quickly reads the cached data. in this procedure, data a was 
virtualized because the partitioned data a was aggregated as if originally single data a was and 
then was used for multiple dsf service customers. that is, dsf service customer #1 and #2 
read same data.
