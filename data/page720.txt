6.1.2 functional view for bdaas 
the functional architecture of cloud computing in [itu -t y.3502] describes functional components in terms 
of a layering framework where specific types of functions are grouped into each layer and where there are 
interfaces between the functional components in successive layers. 
the functional components for bdaas represent sets of funct ions that are necessary to perform the bdaas 
activities for various roles and sub-roles. 
6.1.3 cross-cutting aspects for bdaas 
cross-cutting aspects include both architectural and operational considerations. cross -cutting aspects for 
bdaas apply to multiple elements within the description of the functional architecture or in connection with 
its operation as an instantiated system. these cross-cutting aspects for bdaas are shared issues across roles, 
activities and functional components. 
6.2 relationship between user view and functional view 
figure 6-2 illustrates the relationship between the user view and functional view for bdaas.
