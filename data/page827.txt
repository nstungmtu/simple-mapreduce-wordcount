1 scope 
this recommendation specifies inter-cloud computing functional architecture, including functions and 
functional components, based on the inter -cloud computing framework specified in [itu -t y.3511]. the 
recommendation builds upon the functional view of the cloud computin g reference arch itecture 
[itu-t y.3502] and makes extensions to functional components with inter-cloud functions. 
the scope of this recommendation consists of: 
– overview of inter-cloud computing functional architecture; 
– functions of inter-cloud computing; 
– functional components of inter-cloud computing architecture.
