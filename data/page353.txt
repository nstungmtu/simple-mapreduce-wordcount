table ii.2 – virtualized distributed cluster service 
3) monitor and collect. csc:bdsu monitors the health and progress of the distributed 
cluster using the tools provided by the csp. when the distributed processing job is 
completed the csc:bdsu retrieves the output in the specified storage space. 
a virtual distributed cluster service could be used in a variety of applications, including 
log analysis, web indexing, data warehousing, machine learning, financial analysis, 
scientific simulation and bioinformatics.

pre-conditions 
(optional) 
– the csc:bdsu has registered in the service platform of the csp of the virtual 
distributed cluster service. 
– the csc:bdsu has applied the cloud storage space for accepting the input data and 
output data from the virtual distributed cluster service cluster. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
– the csc:bdsu could quickly create the specified cluster with the desired number of 
virtual machines and software versions. 
– the csc:bdsu gets the processing results after a planned time period.  
derived requirement – data storage (refer to clause 8.3, requirement 1)  
– data analysis (refer to clause 8.4, requirements 2, 4, 7) 
– data management (refer to clause 8.6, requirements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)  
– data security and protection (refer to clause 8.7, requirements 2, 3, 4)
