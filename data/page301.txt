as illustrated in figure 8 -9, the cscs use services provided by the primary csp. the catalogue of service 
offerings in the primary csp includes services from the secondary csp. since the cscs use services through 
the primary csp, the primary csp is responsible for ensuring that the service levels provided to the csc meet 
the sla.

steps as shown in figure 8-10 are as follows: 
1) the primary csp collects service information from the secondary csps, or the secondary csps 
register their services to the primary csp. difference in terms of slas is negotiated as well; 
2) the primary csp creates the catalogue of service offerings by combining the list of hosted services
