7 patterns of inter-cloud  
this clause introduces three patterns of inter -cloud for describing relations and interactions involving 
multiple csps, i.e.,: 
– the inter-cloud peering;  
– the inter-cloud federation; 
– the inter-cloud intermediary. 
7.1 inter-cloud peering  
in inter-cloud peering, two csps interwork directly with each other in order to use the services provided by 
the peer csp.  
note 1 – inter-cloud peering does not necessarily imply reciprocal relationships in terms of service use and service 
providing between the two csps. 
note 2 – inter-cloud peering is a fundamental pattern, which may exist on its own or can be used in the two patterns 
described in clauses 7.2 (inter-cloud federation) and 7.3 (inter-cloud intermediary). 
in inter-cloud peering, each csp exposes its own api for cloud interworking and the csps interwork with each 
other directly by using the other csp's api. as shown in figure 7-1, csp a interworks with csp b using the api 
provided by csp b and vice versa. since the inter -cloud peering pattern can be used in  the other pattern 
described in clauses 7.2 and 7.3, use of a common api between csp a and csp  b is not precluded 
(see figure 7-2).

figure 7-1 – inter-cloud peering  
as shown in figure 7-1, the inter-cloud peering pattern consists of two inter-cloud relationships, csp a to csp 
b relationship and csp b to csp a relationship. csp a is a primary csp when using the services of csp b 
provided by api (b) for providing services to its own customers (csc1 and csc2) and is also a secondary csp 
when providing services to csp b through its own api (a).

figure 7-2 – common api in the peering pattern 
figure 7-2 illustrates the case where a common api is used between csp a and csp b, i.e., api (a) and api (b) 
in figure 7-1 are the same.
