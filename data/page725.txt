7.2.1 distributed processing functional component 
the distributed processing functional component is responsible for processing data by the distributed cluster 
resources. this functional component provides distributed  computing, as well as storage options for 
intermediate or final processing results to satisfy the requirements of different data types and scenarios. 
this functional component supports: 
– processing data by the distributed cluster reso urces with each node  containing pieces of whole 
datasets and processing that data locally in parallel, and write the intermediate or final processing 
results to file system or memory cache; 
 note – cluster resources refer to the physical or virtual servers of the distributed processing cluster. 
– processing data by the distributed cluster resources with nodes organizing into logical topology 
where data flows through. 
7.3 multi-layer functional components  
7.3.1 integration functional components 
the service integration functional component, in the integration functional components , is extended for 
bdaas (see figure 7-4) with the following functional components: 
– third-party service integration functional component (see clause 7.3.1.1).

7.3.1.1 third-party service integration functional component 
the third -party service integration functional component supports the development of service 
implementation tools which assist in modifying and adapting the service from a set of third-party services. 
this functional component supports: 
– integrating multiple big data services; 
– integrating third-party services with operational systems, as well as reporting tools or systems; 
– integrating, adjusting and optimizing user-defined algorithms.  
7.3.2 security systems functional components 
the authorization and security policy management functional component, in the security systems functional 
components, is extended for bdaas (see figure 7-5) with the following functional components: 
– security and privacy management functional component (see clause 7.3.2.1).
