use cases from cloud service providers' views 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this appendix describes nine inter-cloud related use cases from the perspective of the cloud service provider.  
introduction to participants 
for the purpose of this analysis, the following participants are considered. each of the boxes in figure  ii.1 
represents a cloud service provider (csp).

figure ii.1 – inter-cloud participants and relationships  
participant description 
user the human or machine end-user of the overall cloud computing service. 
csp cloud service provider: party (e.g., information technology (it) or telecom 
organization) which makes cloud services available. this may include any of 
the cloud services (saas, caas, paas, iaas, and naas).  
enterprise private cloud it resources within an enterprise that are constructed using cloud computing 
technologies, but which are owned and operated by the enterprise for their 
own internal use. 
not included for inter-cloud – hosting services using non-cloud technologies. 
– connectivity services not employing cloud technologies. 
the above categorization of participants is for the purpose of use case analysis only and does not imply 
specific business or regulatory situations. not all participants identified will be present in all situations. 
some organizations may fulfil multiple participant roles.  
 
relationship description 
icn inter-cloud relationship (focus of study) 
the relationships labelled on the diagram are used to clarify the use cases and do not necessarily indicate 
information flows or interfaces that require standardization by itu. the relationships shown as dashed lines 
(- - - -) in figure ii.1 are included for completeness and are outside the scope of inter-cloud.
