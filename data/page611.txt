this fc provides capabilities for the control and 
application of authorization for users to access 
specific capabilities or data. this fc is somewhat 
related with the infrastructure access 
management in that they cover authorization, 
but daas focuses on authority for resource 
access.

this fc is partially related with uapm-f in that it

contracted hw/sw, but this does explain all of 
this function.

the resources are typically organized into 
resource pools with key characteristics:  
• standardized hardware componentry and 
configuration 
• readily expandable through the addition of 
new hardware capacity 
• automated shifting of resources as workload 
needs change 
• reduce and/or eliminate downtime through 
movement of workloads and data between 
resources 
• manage resource consumption based on 
goals
