1) the csp designs and creates the naas service operational policy data model on npap. 
2) the npap requests the npip to store the newly created naas service operational policy data model. 
3) the npip sends an acknowledgement to the npap. 
4) the npip stores the newly created naas service operational policy data model in the repository. 
5) the npdp requests the naas service operational policy data model from the npip for decision. 
6) the npip sends an acknowledgement to the npdp. 
7) the npdp decides how to deal with the naas service operational policy data model. 
8) the npdp distribut es the naas service operational pol icy data mod el to the npep which 
subscribed it. 
9) the npep sends an acknowledgement to the npdp. 
10) the npep enforces the naas service operational policy data model once it is triggered. 
10 security considerations 
security aspects for consideration within the cloud computing environment, including inter-cloud computing, 
are addressed by security challenges for csps as described in [itu-t x.1601]. [itu-t x.1601] analyses security 
threats and challenges, and describes secu rity capabilities that could mitigate these threats and meet the 
security challenges. this recommendation does not introduce any new security issues.
