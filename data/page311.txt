derived requirements for cloud 
capability 
the system is required to support: 
– policy negotiation including sla management among the multiple csps 
within a pre-established group; 
– self-activity monitoring at a csp or mutual activity monitoring among the 
csps in a pre-established group. if the activity disappears, the detecting csp 
should initiate the pre-configured actions; 
– discovery, reservation, use and release of cloud resources in a dynamic 
manner (i.e., not relying on the pre-configuration) on other csps within the 
federation; 
– application invocation over the reserved resources on other csps within the 
federation; 
– alteration and reversion (i.e., switchover and switchback), in a dynamic 
manner (i.e., not relying on the pre-configuration), of csc access to any csp 
within the federation; 
– exchange of monitoring and auditing information among the multiple csps 
within the federation; 
– exchange of authentication information about csc (user/enterprise) 
authentication status among the multiple csps within the federation.  
i.5 service continuity (in the case of service termination of the original csp) 
table i.5 shows an inter-cloud use case for service continuity in the case of service termination of the original 
csp.
