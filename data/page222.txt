table ii.2 – preparing a physical machine – use case 
title preparing a physical machine 
description a cloud service operations manager installs multiple processing units on the backplane of an 
enclosure to increase the computing resources of a physical machine. he or she also installs 
more than one storage device per cpu in a processing unit through standard storage 
interfaces. 
to connect all multiple processing units together, a cloud service operations manager 
mounts a switch device which is responsible for system interconnects and network topology 
to the backplane of the enclosure. 
in addition, the enclosure is equipped with a power supply to provide power to an entire 
physical machine and a cooling device to reduce heating. a cloud service operations manager 
should be able to check whether each device is installed in a physical machine correctly 
through a console panel on the enclosure. 
system software and operating systems are installed on corresponding devices or rebooted 
and consequently a physical machine completes to set up its operations.  
based on the above steps to construct a physical machine, several physical machines are 
connected with each other by their external interfaces and can be installed in a standard 
rack. 
roles/sub-roles csp: cloud service operations manager.
