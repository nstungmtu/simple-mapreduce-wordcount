use case 
name general csc-csp-csn use case 
abstract this general use case, which describes the general activities of the csc, csp and csn, consists 
of a set of use cases. it introduces a basic scenario where a csp publishes a cloud service. a 
csc or csn consults this cloud service and uses this cloud service. these use cases clarify the 
relationships between these three main cloud roles.

use case 
name use case publish service 
abstract a csp publishes cloud service information to the public so that any users including a csp, csc 
or csn can use the published cloud service. in terms of service publishing, the csp adds the 
service to a service catalogue which will be accessible to others. the csp also maintains the 
catalogue.

use case 
name use case consult service 
abstract a csc, csp or csn consults a published service. for all the published services in the cloud 
service catalogue, any users including the csc, csp and csn can access them. the consult 
scenario refers to consulting published-service details and associated slas.  
roles csc, csp, csn 
pre-conditions 
(optional) 
– the service to be used has already been published by a csp (uc -ps). 
– the csc, csp or csn has been authenticated. 
post-conditions
