the scope of this supplement to itu -t y.3500-series is to study and present the situation relating to the 
application of cloud computing services in developing countries, the obstacles encountered and the facets 
that would stimulate assimilation of cloud computing services based on experiences from these countries. 
the supplement also highlights the current requirements for provision and deployment of cloud computing 
services and to what extent cloud computing standards are applied in developing countries.
