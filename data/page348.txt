table i.6 – big data based mobile network (3g/4g) billing detail query 
title big data based mobile network (3g/4g) billing detail query 
description telecom operators use big data application services to provide detailed billing information of 
mobile network users. telecom mobile network users use 3g/4g networks to access mobile 
internet services using mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablet computers .the access 
network devices, such as pdsn or combined gprs service node (sgsn/cgsn) devices, record all 
kinds of billing information of each of the mobile network users into a standardized format, 
such as a charging detail record (cdr). a charging gateway function (c gf) modular collects 
different charging records and forwards these charging records to the billing system. the billing 
system keeps and processes all the cdrs from different cgfs and finally generates the charging 
bill for each mobile user. telecom operators set up big data infras tructure and store huge 
amounts of user billing detail information. 
mobile network users could quickly query the detailed billing information based on the big data 
infrastructure and big data applications. a mobile network user could get the statistics and 
analytics information for instance in terms of time, type of website and applications accessed 
through a 3g/4g mobile network for his/her internet access actions  through 3g/4g mobile 
networks.
