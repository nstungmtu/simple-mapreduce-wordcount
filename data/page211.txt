recommendation 
relationship with related specifications from other sdos 
– [b-ocp mb] provides storage hibernation as 'the bios should be tuned to 
minimize system power consumption and maximize performance. this 
includes: disable any unused devices, such as unused pci, pcie ports, usb 
ports, sata/sas ports, clock generator and buffer ports. tuning 
cpu/chipset settings to reach minimized power consumption and best 
performance in a data centre environment' in clause 6.3.1. 
13 hardware-assisted i/o 
virtualization 
– [b-ocp obios] describes how intel virtualization technology (intel  vt) must 
be supported via platform bios policy variable, in clause 4.8. 
14 i/o devices direct 
accessing 
– [b-ocp 25gdual] describes how ql41202 shall support single root i/o 
virtualization (sr-iov), in clause 12. 
15 workload offload – [b-ocp 25gdual] describes how ql41202 shall support offload traffic types 
rdma over converged ethernet (roce) on each of the ports and also 
support internet wide area rdma protocol (iwarp), in clause 12. 
16 hardware acceleration – [b-ocp obios] describes key features for wcs intel xeon scalable platform, 
support 2 gp-gpu+1 pcie card in 2u, in clause 2.2. 
– [b-ocp bs] describes qct grantley platform will be 16 dimms and support 8 
gpgpu cards and max. 8x 2.5"hdds' in clause 1. 
17 power supply 
replacement 
– [b-ocp ocsssd] describes how ocs v2.0 servers shall support drives with 
volatile write caches by leveraging the server backup power supply in clause 
11.3 power-loss protection. 
– [b-ocp octam] indicates that when psu alert# signal occurs, the olympus 
psu has transitioned its power source from ac to battery backup, in 
clause 7.4. 
18 supporting power 
redundancy 
– [b-etsi eve007] provide power redundancy as 'power supply redundancy 
may be achieved by installing more than one power supply unit' in 
clause 5.3.3.2. 
– [b-ocp 1s] require platform designers to provide adequate power and 
cooling to properly handle the soc's power and thermal requirements, in 
clause 3 overview. 
– [b-ocp 1s] require twin lakes 1s server to provide a standby 3.3v_aux 
power rail on the card to power the bridge ic at all power states, in 
clause 8.1.2. 
– [b-ocp hsas] describe that the hyve solutions ambient series-e servers 
support single or redundant power supply, in clause 11. 
19 minimum energy 
consumption 
– [b-etsi eve007] provides minimum energy consumption as 'different forms 
of processors would be utilized for different types of services to improve 
power efficiency' in clause 5.2. 
– [b-ocp 1s] describes that the twin lakes 1s server recommend a power -
capping implementation to reduce the server's power consumption (cut off 
power in certain time) in clause 8.4. 
– [b-ocp oapm] describe that the motherboard supports emergency power 
reduction mechanism (pwrbrk#) for the x16 pcie slots in clause 7.5.  
– [b-ocp octam] describes how the motherboard supports emergency 
power reduction mechanism (pwrbrk#) for the x16 and x32 pcie slots in 
clause 7.5. 
– [b-ocp omb] describes how the motherboard supports emergency power 
reduction mechanism (pwrbrk#) for the x16 pcie slots in clause 6.5, the 
main purpose is to provide a power reduction mechanism for gpgpu cards 
as part of the throttle and power capping strategy.
