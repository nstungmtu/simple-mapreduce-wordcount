oss reference points 
(this annex forms an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this annex describes reference points related to oss whose functional com ponents are described in 
clause 8.3 of the naas functional architecture. 
figure a.1 identifies the referen ce points internal to the os s (reference points labelled as ''oss'') as well as 
reference points between the oss and external entities. 
for a naas service that involves either a ''legacy'' (i.e., non-virtualized) network functions (i.e. , pnfs), the 
''oss for naas services '' will interact with the oss (called ''legacy oss'' in figure a.1) responsible for the 
management of these ''legacy'' network functions. the ''oss legacy'' system typically includes management 
systems such as network management systems (nmss) or element management systems (emss).
