[ogf gfd.183] open cloud computing interface – core 
the occi core specification defines the occi core model. the occi core model can be interacted with 
renderings (including associated behaviours) and expanded through extensions. 
[ogf gfd.184] – open cloud computing interface – infrastructure 
occi infrastructure contains the definition of the occi infrastructure extension for the iaas domain. the 
specification defines additional resource types, their attributes and the actions that can be taken on each 
resource type. 
[ogf gfd.185] – open cloud computing interface – restful http rendering
