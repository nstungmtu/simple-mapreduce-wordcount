8 relationships between daas functions and functional components of cloud computing reference 
architecture 
figure 8-1 shows the m apping between the daas functions in clause 7 and the f unctional components in 
[itu-t y.3502]. 
 
figure 8-1 – mapping between daas functions and functional components of  
cloud computing reference architecture 
among the 18 daas functions identified in clause 7, 14 of these can be mapped to functional components in 
[itu-t y.3502]. these mappings, in terms of the layering framework, are as follows: 
– user layer: 
• user function: service connection function (see clause 7.4.1) 
– access layer: 
• access control functional component: delivery protocol processing function (see clause 7.2.1), 
user access management function (see clause 7.2.3) 
• connection management functional component: client connection management function (see 
clause 7.2.2) 
– resource layer: 
• resource abstraction and  control functional component: resource assignment function (see 
clause 7.1.2), platform virtualization function (see clause 7.1.1) 
• physical resources functional component: performance enhancement for virtualization 
platform function (see clause 7.1.3) 
– multi-layer functions: 
• security systems functional component -authentication and identity management: 
infrastructure access management function (see clause 7.1.4)
