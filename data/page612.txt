incident and 
problem 
management

with platform and virtualization management fc 
and incident and problem management in that 
the function can deal with workload matters and 
prepare the incident by exceptional power 
consumption.

user layer- 
user function 
user function fc supports the service user to 
access and use cloud services. service 
connection is responsible for the connection 
between a virtual desktop and a daas user on 
the client side, so this fc is related with the sc-
f. however, this is not enough to cover specific 
operations of the function.
