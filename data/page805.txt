6 overview of trusted inter-cloud  
the inter -cloud computing concept is based on the relationship (pattern) among multiple cloud service 
providers (csps). this pattern (peering, federation or intermediary) allows the csp to interwork with one or 
more peer csps to assure intermediation and security of services provided by these csps. 
the trusted inter -cloud relationship among multiple csps relies on confidence between cloud service 
customer (csc) and csp, or between csps. one of them has to delegate physical control over application, 
service, resource and data to the others. the appropriate security mechanisms (e.g., security access control, 
security of network connectivity between the csps) are needed during peer csps interactions to achieve 
trusted inter-cloud computing.
