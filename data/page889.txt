intercloud and interoperability 5 
 
  881 
1 scope 
this recommendation specifies the cloud computing infrastructure capabilities type interoperability testing 
between the csc and csp, including interoperability testing of computing services, storage services, network 
services and related management functions , based on the functional r equirements specified in 
[itu-t y.3513]. 
the scope of this recommendation consists of: 
– overview of cloud computing infrastructure capabilities type interoperability testing between the 
csc and csp; 
– computing service interoperability testing between the csc and csp; 
– storage service interoperability testing between the csc and csp; 
– network service interoperability testing between the csc and csp. 
note – this recommendation  is the first part of cloud computing infrastructure capabilities type interoperability 
testing, which focuses on validating the infrastructure capabilities type functions provided by the csp to the csc. the 
second part focuses on validating the interaction between csps in the inter-cloud environment.

3.1 terms defined elsewhere 
this recommendation uses the following terms defined elsewhere: 
3.1.1 activity [itu-t y.3502]: a specified pursuit or set of tasks. 
3.1.2 cloud interoperability [itu-t q.4040]: the capability to interact between cscs and csps or between 
different cpss, including the ability of cscs to interact with cloud services and exchange information, the 
ability for one cloud service to work with other cloud services, and the ability for cscs to interact with the 
cloud service management facilities of the csps.
