– it is recommended the naas csp provide the c sc with an efficient management solution of 
provisioned naas applica tions allowing to integrate the management of the provisioned naas 
applications into the csc's network operation environment. 
7.3 service chain 
– it is recommended that naas csp provides m echanisms allowing for the chaining of naas 
applications, e.g., the required naas applications components and associated order. 
7.4 multiple ip addresses 
– it is recommended that naas application support multiple ip addresses on a network interface when 
it delivers network appliance functions (such as firewalls, load balancers). 
 note – this requirement is also applicable to naas platform and naas connectivity.  
8 functional requirements of naas platform 
this clause provides requirements of naas platform derived from the use cases described in appendix ii. 
8.1 programmable naas platform 
– it is recommended that naas csp supports deployment of network applications on naas platform 
by both the csp and the csc. 
– it is recommended that naas platform provides hardware or software modules specialized for 
network function acceleration. 
– it is recommended that naas platform assures and indicates performance available to the csc's 
applications which are running on it. 
– it is recommended that naas platform service provides a modular software framework to select and 
integrate networking functions, security functions and third party applications. 
– it is recommended that naas csp provides platform support for the csc to manage (e.g., install, 
upgrade or uninstall) csc owned modules. 
– it is recommended that naas platform provides network enablers for the csc to initiate (e.g., design, 
build, manage) and operate the flexible, scalable, functionally expandable networks.  
– it is recommended that naas platform provides a unified control an d management function over 
distributed naas platforms for the csc to change, move, or remove network enablers between naas 
platforms. 
8.2 dynamic and flexible network services composition and steering 
– it is recommended that naas csp steers the csc's traffic via service chain which is dynamically and 
flexibly composed by customized sequences of naas applications on the naas platform according 
to the csc's specific service logic.  
8.3 isolation of service chains for tenants 
– naas csp can optionally support isolation of service chains for tenants, combining different network 
services, implemented on the naas platform. 
8.4 flexible scaling of naas platform 
– it is recommended that naas csp assures flexible scaling of the resources assigned to the naas 
platform to achieve performance objectives of the network services and applications implemented 
on the naas platform. 
 note – this requirement is to meet the changes in services or applications utilization caused by e.g., growth 
of traffic, change in number of users, adding new services, implementing new applications.
