table i.6 – a use case of cloud service selection and configuration from csc 
title a use case of cloud service selection and configuration from csc. 
description a csc accesses a workspace provided by a csn: cloud service broker with previously registered 
ids and passwords.  
cloud services shown in a product catalogue are usually managed in the form of images that 
packages a virtual machine, os and applications. 
to search cloud services that the csc wants to use, the csc inputs information of the cloud 
services into the workspace. the information of the cloud services would be csp's location, 
prices, hardware specification of virtual machine, os types, applications,  sla, etc.   
the csn: cloud service broker can automatically find the services best matched with search 
terms from the csc. the csb workspace also provides the interfaces where the csc can search 
the cloud services in a product catalogue manually.  
in some cases, a csc can configure a cloud service by selecting separate elements of the cloud 
service not by choosing a full packaged cloud service. 
after searching or configuring a cloud service, a csc receives corresponding slas and billing 
information adjusted by the csn: cloud service broker. on csc's acceptance, the contract phase 
begins, otherwise the csc can search and configure cloud services again.
