10.4.1  resource fulfilment functionalities 
this covers a set of functionalities for the fulfilment management of resources for the support of cloud 
services. this functionality includes resource order management. 
10.4.1.1  resource order management 
this set of functionalities manages the e2e lifecycle of a resource order request. this includes validating 
resource availability as well as the resource order request. 
note â€“ resource order management functionality will typically communicate with service order management and 
resource layer functionalities. notifications can be issued to the service order management functionalities during the 
resource order orch estration proces s (especially upon completion). such notification can trigger other steps in the 
service order management functionalities (e.g., resource order completion). 
resource order management functionalities include: 
1) resource order orchestration and distribution. this functionality provides workflow and 
orchestration capability across resource order management. this functionality has the ability to 
distribute the resource order. it also provides functionality to track and manage the overall resource 
order as well as to track the overall order; 
2) resource order validation. this functionality validates the resource order request based on contract, 
catalogue, and provisioning rules; 
3) resource order tracking and lifecycle management.  this functional ity issues valid and complete 
resource orders, and stores the order into an appropriate repository; 
4) resource assign. this functionality addresses resource configurations which are needed to support 
a service order.
