abstract a caas csp provides api and/or software development support such as a software 
development kit (sdk) to enable building of a communication platform and services by a 
csn, or in addition to build communication services offered to csc directly by caas csp. 
this involves both platform capabilities type and application capabilities type.

pre-conditions 
(optional) 
with platform capabilities type: 
– csn wants to develop some product or service, using communication features such as 
video call capability. for example, a non-cloud video game developer could include 
caas-based voice and video calling between players of their game. 
– csp provides carrier-grade video call capabilities to a csn through caas api. 
– csn wants to enhance a device (such as an ip-connected camera) with a remote control 
feature, while the original device only has connectivity capabilities but no 
communication capabilities. 
– csp provides the sdk to a csn, in this case, the csn can add communication capabilities 
to the device.  
with application capabilities type: 
– csc wants to use communication applications on different kinds of devices, such as 
wire-line telephone, mobile phone, ims device, tablet and pc.
