– overview of big data; 
• introduction to big data; 
• big data ecosystem and roles; 
– relationship between cloud computing and big data; 
– cloud-computing-based big data system context and benefits; 
– cloud-computing-based big data requirements; 
– cloud-computing-based big data capabilities.

• itu-t y.3504: this recommendation provides the functional architecture for desktop as a service 
(daas) to specify the detailed function al components and their relationships based on the general 
and functional requirements of [itu-t y.3503]. it addresses the following subjects: 
– daas functionalities related with daas components; 
– daas functional architecture; 
– mapping daas functional architecture to the cloud computing reference architecture.

• itu-t y.cccm -reqts: this recommendation provides an overview of the container concept 
describing its main characteristics and their support of micro-services. the document also identifies 
typical use cases related to the usage of c ontainers and micro -services in cloud computing 
identifying use cases related to the support of the containers as a service cloud service category by 
the csp. based on the identified use cases, requirements and capabilities are derived regarding the 
support of the containers as a service category. this recommendation will consider the work as an 
open source activity initiated by linux foundation projects (open container initiative, and cloud 
native computing foundation), and etsi nfv. the scope of this recommendation consists of: 
– overview of the containers concept; 
– requirements of containers and micro-services; 
– use cases of containers and micro-services.

• itu-t y. 3505: this recommendation provides an overview and functional requirements of data 
storage federation. data storage federation provides a single virtual volume from multiple data 
sources in heterogeneous storage. in this recommendation, configuration for logical components, 
and ecosystem of data storage federation as well as cloud-computing-based data storage federation 
are introduced for data storage federation. functional requirements are derived from use cases.

• itu-t y.ccdc-reqts: this recommendation provides an overview of the distributed cloud w ith the 
main objective of highlighting this important area for future standardization. 
– more specifically, this recommendation covers the following: 
– definition of distributed cloud; 
– concept and scope of distributed cloud; 
– characteristics of distributed cloud; 
– high-level requirements of distributed cloud; 
– distributed cloud use cases is provided in appendix i.
