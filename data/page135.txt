i.4 policy-driven provision and management of dsf local storage 
title policy-driven provision and management of dsf local storage 
description a dsf service provider manages and provides a single virtual volume based on dsf local 
storage policies. the dsf service provider organizes dsf local storage policies by using default 
policies configured by dsf service provider and re-configured by dsf service provider from 
multiple data storages. that is, the dsf service provider's policies are dependent on storage 
provider storage policies in dsf local storage. 
dsf service provider provides the default policies as multiple options (e.g., backup, replication, 
snapshot, auto-scaling and storage type). dsf service customer selects options and dsf service 
provider applies options onto metadata. the options are matched onto corresponding storage 
policies in dsf local storage. the dsf service provider manages the dsf local storage by 
matched functions onto storage policies. all communications with dsf local storage between  
the dsf service provider and dsf local storage provider are performed by storage apis.
