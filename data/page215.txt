relationship with related specifications from other sdos 
32 providing running 
information 
– [b-ocp 1s] provides temperature and power sensors set as 'each card must 
provide following sensors: temperature sensors for soc, dimm, voltage 
regulators and other critical chips' in clause 6.5. 
– [b-ocp 2s] provides running monitor set as 'the vendor should implemen t 
bmc fw to support thermal monitoring, including processor, memory, 
chipset, vrs, pcie card, mezzanine cards, inlet/outlet air temperature and 
airflow sensor' in clause 9.8. 
– [b-ocp ambh] provides memory reliability as 'hardware health monitoring 
display' in clause 5.5. 
– [b-ocp jbog ] provides monitor set as 'the bmc implemented is to have 
access to all analog sensors placed in the system and ensure that they are 
displayed in a sensor data record repository' in clause 7.9.1.1. 
– [b-ocp yose] provides monitor set as 'during the entire hot-service process, 
the bmc shall monitor the thermal condition closely' in clause 5.2. 
– [b-ocp ambh] provides monitor set as 'the bmc can be used to monitor 
hardware and control fan speed' in clause 6. 
– [b-ocp obios] provides multi process configuration set as 'bios 
requirements for intel nm enabled firmware nm5 bios should implement 
processor utilization notifications support in acpi tables' in clause 9.2.2.  
33 automatically power 
operation 
– [b-ocp 1s] provides power operation set as 'the twin lakes 1s server can 
throttle itself down to lowest possible power state as quickly as possible 
when the platform asserts the fast_throttle_n signal or it receives 
request from bmc, or over power event reported by on-card power 
monitor' in clause 8.4，and 'the bmc controls power on, off and reset 
directly via the signals defined in the pin-out' in clause 9.7.13. 
– [b-ocp 2s] provides auto power on set as 'motherboard should be set to 
restore last power state during ac on/off. this means that, when ac does 
on/off cycle, motherboard should power on automatically without requiring 
power button' in clause 15.9. 
– [b-ocp jbog] provides power operation set as 'support power on policy to 
be last-state, always-on and always-off upon recovery from an ac power 
loss event. t' in clause 7.7. 
– [b-ocp yose] provides auto power set as 'now the user can replace the 
failed unit with a new one, bmc would automatically resume power and 
boot the new card' in clause 5.2. 
– [b-ocp obios] provides power controller set as 'the following actions are 
available on expiration of the watchdog timer: • system reset• system 
power off• system power cycle• pre-timeout interrupt (optional)' in 
clause 9.2.2. 
34  monitoring 
environment condition 
 
35 self-checking 
mechanism 
– [b-ocp 2s] provides get selftest result set as 'get selftest results (0x04) in 
clause 9.13. 
– [b-ocp tp] provides selftest set as 'during system boot-up, post (power-
on-selftest ) codes will be send to port 80 and decoded by the bmc to drive 
the led display as described in section 8.5. p' in clause 8.2. 
– [b-ocp obios] provides selftest set as 'built-in self-test (bist) the 
bist_enable can be controlled by a bmc, gpo, strap or other mechanism. 
bios shall implement a platform policy to control bist execution' in 
clause 4.12.
