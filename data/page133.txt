a large file storing from a dsf service provider. the dsf service provider splits the file into

local storages.  
role/sub-role dsf service provider (csp:sfp) 
dsf service customer (csc:csu) 
figure (optional) case 1: limited capacity of data storage in dsf local storage  
 
case 2: csc:csu's parallel access requirement 
 
pre-conditions 
(optional) 
– csp:sfp is available to access dsf local storage. 
– csc:csu requests a single virtual volume to csp:sfp.
