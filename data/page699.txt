9 security considerations 
security aspects for consideration within the cloud computing environment, including naas, are addressed 
by security challenges for naas csps, as described in [itu -t x.1601]. in particular, [itu -t x.1601] analyses 
security threats and challenges, and describes security capabilities that could mitigate these threats and meet 
the security challenges. 
the functional components for security systems defined in clause 9.2.5.2 of [itu-t y.3502] are applicable in 
the context of the naas functional architecture. these components are responsible for applying security
