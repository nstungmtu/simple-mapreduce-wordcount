ii.4.2.5 naas connectivity use case for performance on demand 
 
title naas connectivity use case for performance on demand 
description csc requests csp to provide on-demand network performance (such as bandwidth 
quantities, maximum latencies and other qos parameters), which includes dynamic 
establishment, change and resized capacity of links. however, traditional solution based on 
human intervention lacks automation capabilities which make it difficult to deliver self -
provisioned services and respond to time-sensitive changes in network performance 
requirements. additionally, frequent changes sometimes result in congestion and 
instability because traffic, which comes from multiple sources, shares the same network 
link.  
csp provides csc the appropriate control in order to request services through a portal and 
to shield the underlying physical network to the csc.
