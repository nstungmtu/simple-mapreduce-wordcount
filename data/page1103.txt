7 questionnaire findings 
an itu -t survey was commissioned to assess the current profile of cloud computing deployment in 
developing countries. to this effect two questionnaires on cloud computing status in developing countries 
were formulated. the first questionnaire was designed for cloud service customers (csc) and the second one 
for cloud service providers (csp). the questionnaires were made available in word document format and 
online to facilitate a wide range of feedback methods for the respondents. in may 2016 they were 
disseminated to itu members from developing countries with a request to share the questionnaires with the 
cscs and csps in their countries, including entities which were not itu-t members. 
eight (8) responses were received for the csc questionnaire and eighteen (18) for the csp questionnaire from 
seventeen (17) countries. the majority of responses were from africa as highlighted in the appendices and
