1 framework and requirements for cloud computing  
 
266  
9.2 storage interface 
the storage interface requirements include: 
• the storage resource s are required to support either block storage interfaces or file system 
interfaces. 
• the storage resources are recommended to support object storage accessed via web service data 
path interfaces. 
• the storage resources are recommended to support structured data-sharing access interfaces. 
• the storage resources can optionally support multiple types of interfaces. 
9.3 storage management 
the storage management requirements include: 
• it is required to provide the capabilities for user authentication and authorization. 
• it is required to provide management capabilities for storage resources. 
• it is required to provide basic configuration capabilities, including storage domain configuration, file 
system namespace configuration, storage resources configuration an d local file system 
configuration. 
• it is recommended to provide performance monitoring and statistics (e.g., disk i/o speed, disk space 
usage, cpu utilization, memory utilization, job completion). 
• it is recommended to support alert capabilities, e.g., for event and trouble reporting. 
• it is recommended to provide replication, archive and retention capabilities. 
9.4 storage availability 
the storage availability requirements include: 
• it is required to monitor data loss or failure. 
• it is recommended to provide data backup and data recovery. 
• it is recommended to provide data verification capabilities. 
• it is recommended to support access through legitimate channels without time constraints, as well 
as the geographical constraints. 
• it is recommended to support data synchronization to keep data consistency. 
9.5 data de-duplication 
the data de-duplication is a method of reducing storage usage by eliminating redundant data. the data de -
duplication can save resources of storage space and network bandwidth to transfer data.  
the data de-duplication requirement includes: 
• it is recommended for storage resources to support the data de-duplication capability.  
10 requirements for resources abstraction and control 
resources abstraction and control allows a csp to access physical resources through software abstraction. it 
also provides composition, coordination, monitoring and scheduling of processing, storage and networking 
resources. 
resources abstraction and control directs the creation, modification, customization and release of abstracted 
resources. resource abstraction and control is also responsible for controlling the interactions between 
resource pools and cloud services. a resource template refers to a set of standardized formatted hardware 
and software configuration settings for processing, storage and networking resources.
