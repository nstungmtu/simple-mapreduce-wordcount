1 framework and requirements for cloud computing  
 
68  
• configuring and maintaining operating systems and hypervisors; 
• administering a virtualization environment;  
• monitoring the behaviour of the ict environment of the cloud service provider to ensure that it is 
running correctly and that provided cloud services are meeting the terms of the sla;  
• recording problems, reporting problems appropriately (which can involve a message being sent to 
one or more customers), and following problem resolution processes until the problem is fixed. 
8.3.2.3 manage assets and inventory 
the manage assets and inventory activity involves: 
• keeping track of all compute, storage, network and software assets and the relationship between 
them. this includes tracking aspects such as versions and patch levels, plus configuration 
information, where relevant; 
• 'on-boarding' of new assets and disposal of old assets. this can include ensuring that new assets are 
fit for purpose and have been properly checked from a securit y and manageability standpoint and 
can include the disposal of assets that are no longer required. this can include appropriate secure 
disposal of any assets that might hold data. 
8.3.2.4 provide audit data 
the provide audit data activity is the collection and provision of data relevant to an audit request, such as 
that relating to security controls or to service performance. the data requested will depend on the auditing 
scheme or standard that is being used. this activity involves: 
• creating and sending appropriate audit information from logs, etc.; 
• redacting information from any log records or other data that might contain sensitive information 
or pii. 
8.3.2.5 define environment and processes 
the define environment and process activity focuses on defining the required technical environment and 
operational processes used when a service is running. this activity involves: 
• defining the required technical environment in terms of compute, storage and network resources, 
the software dependencies including configuration; 
• defining policies and processes for scaling up and scaling down the use of resources in response to 
changing usage demand; 
• assuring that the cloud service adheres to appropriate standards relating to security and business 
compliance; 
• defining the processes to follow when the service is running, including plans for fixes, upgrades and 
migration. 
8.3.2.6 define and gather metrics 
the define and gather metrics activity focuses on d efining service level metrics and management. this 
activity involves: 
• defining the metrics that are used in relation to the operation of cloud services, which are typically 
reflected in the sla relating to those services; 
• designing how the metrics are captured for each cloud service; 
• defining how the metrics are reported and managed, in particular to ensure that sla targets are 
met.
