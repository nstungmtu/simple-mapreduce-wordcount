in figure a.7, the lines from the development environment show that the development environment and 
build management system are used to create the software and related artefacts of the service 
implementation which offers the service interface. the cloud service developer can also create the service 
access implementation. 
in order for the service implementation and service access to run in the target execution environment, the 
correct enablement for security, monitoring, management and automation needs to be developed, as well 
as enablement for integration into the service execution environment. the cloud service developer discovers 
the appropriate enablement for monitoring integration, security integration and service integration by using 
the development access capabilities. in addition, information and requirements for enabling authentication 
and identity management, as well as authorization and security policy management, is retrieved via the 
development access functional component. 
the enablement of the cloud service implementation for deployment and provisioning is also done using the 
development environment and build management system (e.g., via scripts and configuration metadata files). 
the cloud se rvice developer uses the development access functional component  to discover what the 
provisioning and deployment requirements are. 
the service implementation is packaged with the deployment and provisioning information and passed to 
the csp:cloud service manager to perform the deploy services activity resulting in the service being available 
for use by customers in the provide services activity.
