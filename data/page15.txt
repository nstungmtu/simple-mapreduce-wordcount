3.2.9 cloud service broker : cloud service partner  (3.2.14) that negotiates relationships between cloud 
service customers (3.2.11) and cloud service providers (3.2.15). 
3.2.10 cloud service category: group of cloud services (3.2.8) that possess some common set of qualities.

cloud services (3.2.8). 
note – a business relationship does not necessarily imply financial agreements.

published interface of the cloud service (3.2.8). 
note 1 – an example of legal controls is copyright.

be data made available by the cloud service providers (3.2.15), or obtained from another source, or it might be publicly available 
data. however, any output data produced by the actions of the cloud service customer (3.2.11) using the capabilities of the cloud 
service (3.2.8) on this data is likely to be cloud service customer data (3.2.12), following the general principles of copyright, unless 
there are specific provisions in the cloud service (3.2.8) agreement to the contrary.
