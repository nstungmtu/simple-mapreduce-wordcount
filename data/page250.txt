use case 
name general use case of distributed cloud. 
description the use case describes the scenarios for the csc to use a published cloud service. 
the cloud service has already been published by a csp and can be browsed through the 
product catalogue provided by the csp. 
the csc subscribes the cloud  service with various requirements, for example,  different 
requirements for service capacity and network latency. 
the distributed cloud realizes service provisioning to provide cloud service on appropriate 
core, regional, or edge cloud, according to the csc's subscription.
