• itu-t l.1200: this recommendation specifies the direct current (dc) interface between the power 
feeding system and ict equipment connected to it. it also describes normal and abnormal voltage 
ranges, and immunity test levels for ict equipment to maintain the stability  of telecommunication 
and data communication services. the specified interface is operated from a dc power source of up
