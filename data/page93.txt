figure 9-2 – functional components of the ccra  
9.2.1 user layer functional components 
the user layer functional components include: 
• user function; 
• business function; 
• administrator function. 
the cloud services  that are presented to csc:cloud service users can be broken down into two major 
categories, functional services and self-service management services. the latter can be further divided into 
business and administration services. 
the interface that is presented to the user of the cloud service encompasses the primary function of the 
cloud service. this is distinct from the interface that is used to manage the use of the cloud service. but all 
cases are cloud services, tailored for different types of capabilities. 
9.2.1.1 user function 
the user function functional component supports the csc:cloud service user to access and use cloud services 
(the use service activity). in some cases, the user function functional component could be as simple as a 
browser running on a user device. however, in other cases, it might involve a sophisticated enterprise system 
running business processes, applications, middleware and associated infrastructure. 
9.2.1.2 business function 
the business function functional component supports the cloud computing activities  of the csc:business 
manager including the selection and purchase of cloud services; the accounting and financial management 
relating to the use of cloud services. it should be noted that business capabilities are themselves offered via 
cloud services.
