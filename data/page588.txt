throughout this recommendation, the term "daas user" is to be understood as equivalent to "cloud service 
user (csu)". 
6 relationship between daas logical components and daas functions 
there are five daas logical components in recommendation [itu-t y.3503]: 
1) daas client; 
2) connection manager; 
3) resource pool; 
4) virtualization infrastructure; 
5) virtual desktop delivery. 
note – the relationship between the daas logical components and the cloud computing reference architecture in 
[itu-t y.3502] is described in appendix i. 
in daas, a connection manager is configured to establish connections to a daas client  and manage these 
connections. virtual desktops in the virtualization infrastructure are provided to daas user s through virtual 
desktop delivery. the r esource pool is provisioned or configured to as sign optimum resources to virtu al 
desktops for the daas clients. these daas logical components are realized by the following daas functions: 
– virtualization infrastructure support functions: these functions support daas in terms of 
virtualization infrastructure with resource pool; 
– virtual desktop connection and delivery functions: these functions configure, provision, and deliver 
virtual desktops in connection manager and virtual desktop delivery; 
– virtual desktop resource management functions: these fu nctions manage resources in r esource 
pool for virtual desktops; 
– daas client support functions: these functions support daas from a daas client's perspective. 
table 6-1 shows the relationship between daas logical components in [itu -t y.3503] and daas functions in 
this recommendation.
