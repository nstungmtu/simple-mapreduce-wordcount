figure 7-3 â€“ high-level procedural flows for real-time media storage 
figure 7-3 shows the procedural flows of real-time media storage in a cloud storage system: 
(1) the cu initiates a storage plan request and sends this request to the scu. 
(2) the scu forwards this storage plan request to the cmu. 
(3) the cmu authenticates the storage access permission and then sends this storage plan request  to 
the csmu.  
(4) the csmu authenticates the storage access permission and then sends this storage plan request to 
the csau. 
(5) the csau returns a response to the csmu when it is ready for this storage plan. 
(6) the csmu returns the csau information to the cmu. 
(7) the cmu sends a response including the csau information to the scu. 
(8) the scu forwards this response to the cu. 
(9) when the cu receives the csau information, it sends the real-time media storage request to the 
csau. 
(10) when the csau receives the storage request, it sends a request to the scu for the media address. 
(11) the scu forwards this request to the mdu. 
(12) the mdu returns the media address to the scu.
