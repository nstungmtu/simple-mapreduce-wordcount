• iso/iec 19086-2: this part of iso/iec 19086 defines a model for specifying metrics for cloud service 
level agreements (slas) and includes applications of the model with examples. this part of iso/iec 
19086 establishes a common terminology and approach for specifying metrics. 
 this standard is for the benefit and use of both cloud service providers and cloud service customers. 
 this standard is intended to complement iso/iec 19086-1, iso/iec 19086-3 and iso/iec 19086-4. 
 this part of iso/iec 19086 does not mandate the use of a specific set of metrics for cloud slas. 
 this part of iso/iec 19086 does not supersede any legal requirement.

• iso/iec 19086-3: this international standard specifies core conformance requirements for service 
level agreements (slas) for cloud services for iso/iec 19086. this standard is for the benefit and use 
for providers and customers.  
 this standard does not provide a standard structure that would be used for cloud sla contracts. 
 this document does not supersede any legal requirement.

• iso/iec 19086 -4: this document specifies security and protection of personally identifiable 
information components, slos and sqos for cloud service level agreements (cloud slas) including 
requirements and guidance. this document is for the benefit and use of both csps and cscs. 
 note – iso/iec 19086-4 is initiated in jtc 1/sc 38 and transferred to jtc 1/sc 27.

• iso/iec 19941: this document specifies cloud computing interoperability and portability types, the 
relationship and interactions between these two cross -cutting aspects of cloud computing, and 
common terminology and concepts used to discuss interoperability and portability and particularly 
relating to cloud services. this document is related to other s tandards namely iso/iec 17788, 
iso/iec 17789, iso/iec 19086 -1, iso/iec 19944, and in particular references the cross -cutting 
aspects and components identified in iso/iec 17788 and iso/iec 17789 respectively. the goal of this 
document is to ensure that all parties involved in cloud computing, particularly cscs, csps and csns 
acting as cloud service developers, have a common understanding of interoperability and portability 
for their specific needs. this common understanding helps to achieve interoperability and portability 
in cloud computing by establishing common terminology and concepts.

• iso/iec 19944 : this document extends the existing cloud computing vo cabulary and reference 
architecture in iso/iec 17788 and iso/iec 17789 to describe an ecosystem involving devices 
consuming cloud services, describes the various types of data flowing within the devices and cloud 
computing ecosystem, describes the impact of connected devices on the data that flows within the 
cloud computing ecosystem, describes flows of data between cloud services, cloud service 
customers and cloud service users, provides foundational concepts, including a data taxonomy, 
identifies the cate gories of data that flow across the cloud service customer devices and cloud 
services. this document is applicable primarily to cloud service providers, cloud service customers 
and cloud service 56 users, but also to any person or organization involved in legal, policy, technical 
or other implications of data 57 flows between devices and cloud services.
