ii.1 test cases for computing service interoperability testing between the csc and csp 
ii.1.1 test case: vm configuration 
table ii.1 â€“ test case: vm configuration 
vm configuration test description 
test purpose to verify that the csc configures the vm with processors, hard disks, memory and nic 
parameters. 
reference [itu-t y.3513] clause 7.1.2 
test sequence step type description result 
1 stimulus the csc configures the processor parameters of the vm, in 
the permissible range of physical resources conditions.  
 
2 check processor parameters configuration is in effect. the 
processor of the vm is consistent with the parameters 
specified in step 1. 
 
3 stimulus the csc configures the hard disk parameters of the vm, in 
the permissible range of physical resources conditions. 
 
4 check hard disk parameters configuration is in effect. the hard 
disks of the vm are consistent with the parameters specified 
in step 3. 
 
5 stimulus the csc configures the nic parameters of the vm, in the 
permissible range of physical resources conditions. 
 
6 check nic parameters configuration is in effect. the nic of the vm 
is consistent with parameters specified in step 5. 
 
test verdict it is deemed as successfully terminated if all the checks are successful, otherwise it is 
deemed as failed. 
 
 
ii.1.2 test case: vm migration 
table ii.2 shows the test case for vm migration.
