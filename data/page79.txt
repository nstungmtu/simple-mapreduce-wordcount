• federation involves using the cloud services of a group of peer cloud service providers who mutually 
combine their service capabilities in order to provide the set of cloud servi ces required by 
customers; 
• intermediation involves a cloud service provider  offering a cloud service  which is based on 
conditioning or enhancing the cloud service  of a peer cloud service provider . examples of 
enhancements include managing access to cloud services, providing a cloud service  application 
programming interface (api) façade, identity management, performance reporting, enhanced 
security, and so on; 
• aggregation involves a cloud service provider  offering a cloud service  which is based on the 
composition of a set of services provided by peer cloud service providers; 
• arbitrage involves a cloud service provider offering a cloud service which is based on selecting one 
service offering from a group offered by peer cloud service providers. 
8.3.2.17 manage security and risks  
the manage security and risks activity focuses on the management of security and risks associated with the 
development, delivery, use and support of cloud services. this activity involves: 
• defining information security policy – taking into consideration the service requirements, statutory 
and regulatory requirements and contractual and sla obligations; 
• defining information security risks relating to the cloud service and the approach to those risks that 
meets the busi ness goals of the cloud service provider.  a significant point here is that managing 
information security risks has an associated cost and that the provider can take a business position 
of not handling some risks, instead passing over responsibility for tho se risks to the cloud service 
customer via the service agreement, in order to address the cost requirements of some part of the 
marketplace. 
• selecting design point and associated information security  controls required to address risks 
associated with the service and design point chosen. the controls typically cover a set of categories, 
such as: 
– identity and access management; 
– discover, categorize, protect data and information assets; 
– information systems acquisition, development and maintenance; 
– secure infrastructure against threats and vulnerabilities; 
– problem and information security incident management; 
– security governance and compliance; 
– physical and personnel security; 
– security of networks and communications; 
– isolation (between tenants in a multi-tenant situation). 
• ensuring that the identified controls are in place for the deployed service and the underlying 
infrastructure; 
• designing, implementing and evaluating system and application security; 
• managing, designing, implementing and evaluating the security of cloud services  of peer cloud 
service providers; 
• evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented controls and make changes based on experience; 
• assuring that operating and business support systems provide data access to cloud service provider 
staff based on the particular cloud service customers tenants they provide a service to.
