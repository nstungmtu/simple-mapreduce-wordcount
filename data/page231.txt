table ii.10 – high reliability deployment – use case 
title a use case for high reliability deployment 
description this use case covers the situation where physical machine will be deployed with high 
reliability. to achieve high reliability, physical machine needs to be deployed with redundant 
main components, such as cpu, power supply and cooling component. in addition, physical 
machine needs to support technology to reduce data errors and data loss at work, such as 
memory error correction and raid. 
trough raid technology, data of physical machine is distributed across multiple drives in 
different ways, referred to as raid levels, depending on the required level of redundancy and 
performance. take raid1 as an example, as shown in below figure, raid 1 consists of an 
exact copy (or mirror) of a set of data on two or more disks. the data of physical machine will 
not loss so long as at least one member drive is operational.

pre-conditions 
(optional) 
csp wishes to deploy physical machines with high reliability. 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
physical machines can still work when some components fail. the physical machine can 
reduce data errors and losses due to memory and storage failures.  
derived 
requirements 
– multiple cpus (see clause 7.1.1.1) 
– memory reliability (see clause 7.1.1.2) 
– storage redundancy hardware (see clause 7.1.1.3) 
– supporting power redundancy (see clause 7.1.2) 
– cooling component redundancy(see clause 7.1.3)
