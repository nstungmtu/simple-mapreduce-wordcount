4 low power 
consumption of cpu 
– [b-ocp 2s] provides low power consumption of cpu as 'tuning cpu/chipset 
settings to reach minimized power consumption and best performance in a 
data centre environment' in clause 6.3.1. 
– [b- ocp 2s] provides low power consumption of cpu as 'the vendor should 
implement bmc firmware to support platform power monitoring. to enable 
power limiting for processor, memory and platform, intel server platform 
services-nm is required' in clause 9.8. 
– [b- ocp 2s] provides low power consumption of cpu as 'cpu vr 
optimizations shall be implemented to remove cost and increase the 
efficiency of the power conversion system' in clause 15.3.2. 
– [b-ocp g1] provides low power consumption of cpu as 'the motherboard 
shall be designed to handle a processor with a maximum tdp of 190w cpu' 
in clause 7.3.1 
– [b- ocp dsbs] provides low power consumption of cpu as 'support up to 
two processors with a thermal design point (tdp) of up to 135 w' in 
clause 4. 
– [b-ocp ambh] provides low power consumption of cpu as 'the cpu vrm is 
optimized to reduce cost and increase the efficiency of the power 
conversion system' in clause 9.1.5. 
– [b- ocp dsbs] provides low power consumption of cpu as 'support up to two 
processors using lga2011-3 (socket type r3) and vrd 12.5 and a thermal 
design point (tdp) of up to 145w' in clause 4. 
– [b-ocp imbh] provides low power consumption of cpu as 'the 
motherboard uses next generation intel xeon processor e5-2600 product 
family cpus with a tdp (thermal design power) up to 115w' in clause 4.3. 
– [b-ocp imbh] provides low power consumption of cpu as 'two to monitor 
temperatures for cpu0 and cpu1, retrieved through the cpu's temperature 
sensor interface (peci)' in clause 6.1. 
– [b-ocp mb] provides low power consumption of cpu as 'the motherboard 
uses intel xeon e5-2600 v3 (lga2011-3) product family processors with tdp 
up to 145w. the features listed below must be supported by the 
motherboard: support two intel xeon e5-2600 v3 (lga2011-3) product 
family processors up to 145w tdp and vendors should engage with intel to 
ensure the design ready for future processors; two full-width intel qpi links 
up to 9.6 gt/s/direction; up to 18 cores per cpu (up to 36 threads with 
hyper-threading technology). up to 45mb last level cache; single processor 
mode is supported' in clause 5.3.1. 
– [b-ocp mb] provides low power consumption of cpu as 'the bios should 
be tuned to minimize system power consumption and maximize 
performance. this includes: disable any unused devices, such as unused pci, 
pcie ports, usb ports, sata/sas ports, clock generator and buffer ports. 
tuning cpu/chipset settings to reach minimized power consumption and 
best performance in a data centre environment' in clause 6.3.1.
