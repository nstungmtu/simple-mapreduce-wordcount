as is the case with the cloud service customer-cloud service provider relationship there are two functional 
components to the relationship between two cloud service providers: 
• the use of secondary provider cloud services by a primary provider; 
• the use of secondary provider's business and administration capabilities by the primary provider's 
csp:cloud service operations manager and csp:cloud service manager to establish and control the 
use of the secondary provider's cloud services. 
for the secondary provider, the primary provider assumes the role of a cloud service customer. services of 
the secondary cloud service provider  are offered to and used by customers of the primary cloud service 
provider. the resulting linkage between the secondary cloud service provider  and the cloud service 
customer of the primary provider requires specific consideration of issues such as security, protection of pii, 
and data ownership. 
it is essential that the primary provider ensures that the sla offered by the secondary provider's services is 
suitable for the requirements of the primary provider's services  – and that any breaches of the sla are 
managed appropriately. 
there are three interfaces involved in the provider–peer provider relationship – the administration interface, 
the business interface and the service interface(s), which broadly provide the same capabilities as the 
equivalent interfaces in the cloud service customer–cloud service provider relationship. the way in which 
the administration interface is used is shown in figure a.4 and the way in which the service interface is used 
is shown in figure a.5 and the way in which the business interface is used is shown in figure a.6.
