i.2 data sharing between customers 
title data sharing between customers 
description in this scenario, the dsf service customer #1 stored file a~d with data sharing mode policy 
setting. the file a is non-sharing mode, the file b is read-only data sharing mode, the file c is 
over-writable data sharing mode and the file d is replicable data sharing mode. the other dsf 
service customer #2 uses file a~d with data sharing policy set by dsf service customer #1. 
dsf service customer #2 cannot access file a because of non-sharing mode policy setting and 
dsf service customer #2 can read file b but it is not writable. in file c case, dsf service 
customer #2 can overwrite it and store it with changes. in file d case, by a replication request 
by dsf service customer #2, the original file d is preserved and a new file e is generated and 
stored to dsf service customer #2's single virtual volume.
