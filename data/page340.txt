9 cloud computing based big data capabilities 
9.1 data collection capabilities 
data collection capabilities include: 
– data source intelligent recognition, which offers the capabilities to locate the data sources and 
detect the types of data being collected; 
– data adaptation, which offers the capabilities to transform and organize the data being collected 
with targeted data structures and attributes (numbering, location, ownerships, etc.); 
– data integration, which offers the capabilities to integrate data  from different data sources 
(different data types) using metadata or ontology; 
– data brokerage, which offers the capabilities to provide a brokerage service for searching data. 
9.2 data pre-processing capabilities 
data pre-processing capabilities include: 
– data extraction, which offers the capabilities to extract information from the semi -structured data 
or unstructured data; 
– data transmission, which offers the capabilities to transport datasets (static data and real-time data) 
from data sources or between one location to another keeping the integrity and consistency; 
– data de-noising, which offers the capabilities to eliminate noise information from a mixture of signal 
data and noise data; 
– data aggregation, which offers the capabilities to aggregate data which come from different sources 
in the same data model or data format. 
9.3 data storage capabilities 
data storage capabilities include: 
– data storing, which offers the capabilities to store different types and formats of data with elastic 
storage capacity; 
– data registration, which offers the capabilities to create, update and delete the metadata with 
corresponding changes in data storage; 
 note – in the case of unstructured data registration, the data registration component can request the 
transforming of raw data to semi -structured data such as javascript object notation (json) or  binary 
javascript object notation (bson) to define semantic relationships among different datasets for knowledge 
sharing. 
– data access, which offers the capabilities to access data through multiple interfaces, such as web 
service interfaces, file system interfaces, database interfaces and so on; 
– data indexing, which offers the capabilities to create and update indexes for datasets; 
– data duplication and backup, whic h offers the capabilities to duplicate and make backups for 
datasets. 
9.4 data analytics capabilities 
data analytics capabilities include: 
– data preparation, which offers the capabilities to transform data into a form that can be analysed. 
these capabilities include exploring, changing and shaping of the raw data; 
– data analysis, which offers the capabilities of investigation, inspection and modelling of data in order 
to discover useful information; 
– workflow automation, which offers the automation processes, in whole or part, during which data 
or functions are passed from one step to another for actions, according to a set of procedural rules;
