inter-cloud security aspects 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this appendix provides important aspects to be considered regarding inter-cloud security matters.  
one important aspect is the multiple and sometimes complicated csp and csc inter-cloud relationships such 
as those described in clause 7 of this recommendation. for these multiple inter -cloud relationships, 
appropriate secured mechanisms should be supported during the peer csps interactions such as the services 
request phase (e.g.,  access control), service usage phase as well as the security of network  connectivity 
between the csps.  
other aspects to be considered include: 
– establishment of a trust relationshi p between csps is important given that the multiple csps 
involved in inter -cloud may be administrated by different parties. in case of an inter -cloud 
federation, the involved csps may establish trust relationships among them prior to any interactions 
between them or during inter-cloud interactions (e.g., service requests between csps);  
– csc profiles may be shared among the csps involved in the federation. in this case the csc profile 
should be handled in a secure manner and in respect of privacy rules and regulations.
