general use cases for distributed cloud 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
this appendix identifies use cases of distributed cloud. the table below shows the template used for the 
description of the use cases. 
i.1 use case template 
table i.1 – template for the description of a use case 
use case 
name title of use case. 
abstract overview and features of use case. 
figure figure to present the use case. 
(a unified modeling language (uml)-like diagram is suggested for clarifying relations 
between roles). 
pre-conditions 
(optional) 
pre-conditions represent the necessary conditions or use cases that should be achieved 
before starting the described use case. (note) 
post-conditions 
(optional) 
as the same for pre-condition, the post-condition describes conditions or use cases that will 
be carried out after the termination of a currently described use case.  
requirements the title of requirements derived from the use case. for example: 
– large-scale migration. 
note – as dependency may exist among different use cases, pre-conditions and post-conditions are introduced to 
help understand the relationships among use cases.
