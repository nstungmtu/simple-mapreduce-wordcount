1 scope 
this recommendation provides the functional requirements of the physical machine for cloud computing 
based on cloud computing infrastructure requirements presented in [itu-t y.3510]. this recommendation 
addresses the following: 
– overview of the physical machine; 
– functional requirements of the physical machine. the functional requirements provided in this 
recommendation are derived from use cases. 
note 1 – this recommendation does not advocate, imply, or assume the use of any specific set or sets of techn ical 
specifications. examples of such sets of technical specifications can be found in appendix i.  
note 2 – this recommendation addresses a set of use cases which are included in appendix ii.
