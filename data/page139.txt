i.7 efficient data storage management 
title efficient data storage management 
description as shown in figure 1, dsf service provider efficiently manages data to support better storage 
access performance and to reduce management burden. tiering is a technique to fulfil 
efficient data management. by organizing tiered caches, frequently accessed files are stored in 
high speed cache. while access files are rarely stored in a low speed cache. cached files are 
stored on corresponding data storages by managed api. 
as shown in figure 2, a dsf service customer saves a same file on a single virtual volume. to 
avoid waste of data storage capacity dsf service provider performs a de -duplicate data 
operation. for example, when a file is stored, data replication checking is accomplished. as the 
result of the checking, a file is stored. if a same file is already stored, the file is managed by 
data operation metadata.
