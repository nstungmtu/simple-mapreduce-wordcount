note 4 – the bold letter items in table 10-1 are itu-t work in progress activities. 
according to the gap analysis in table 10-1: 
− itu-t has been focusing on 'general/definition', 'common requirement/use cases' with each 
technical area described in vertical axis; 
− it is expected that standardization efforts of itu-t will be moved to 'architecture' of each technical 
areas; 
− consideration on standardizing 'analysis/visualization' is needed; 
− the entries under the column 'api, interface and its profile' of each of technical standardization 
areas are empty. these areas are being developed by open source projects, so itu-t has to consider 
establishing relationships with them.
