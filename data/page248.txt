computing environment and describes security capabilities that could mitigate these threats and meet 
security challenges. 
it is recommended that the guidelines for the operational secur ity of cloud computing described in 
[b-itu-t x.1642] be considered for the distributed cloud. [b -itu-t x.1642] clarifies the security 
responsibilities between csps and cscs, and analyses the requirements and categories of security metrics of 
operational security for cloud computing. 
it is recommended that the security framework for the iot based on the gateway model described in 
[b-itu-t x.1361] be considered for edge clouds in the distributed cloud. in particular, [b -itu-t x.1361]
