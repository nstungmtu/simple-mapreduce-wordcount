c) management of pol icy: cscs require the ability to set policies for which cloud services are 
configured and managed i.e. , controls over who has access to cloud assets, periodic and on -
demand logging and reporting. 
d) managing self-service portal: a self-service portal can be managed by a csp to provide a product 
catalogue and to take cscs' requests and offer a degree of control. 
e) configuring: cloud services can be configured for provisioning and use. 
f) provisioning service : cloud service should  be provisioned automatically accordin g to cscs ' 
requests. 
g) composition/orchestration of services: multiple cloud services may need to be composed into 
a single cloud service. 
h) service decommissioning : for the best utilization of resources, when a clou d service (or 
resource) is suspend ed, it should be managed by freeing the associated resources. 
decommissioning can be achieved on-demand, when a request from a csc occurs or according 
to a schedule. 
i) charging: according to the policy, time of use and se rvice type, charging information can b e 
provided. 
3) e2e cloud service lifecycle management system implemented by csp1 can interact with e2e cloud 
service lifecycle management system implemented by csp2 through the smis between csps as 
shown in figure 6-1.
