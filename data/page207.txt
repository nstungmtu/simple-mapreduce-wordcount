7 memory reliability – [b-ocp 2s] provides memory reliability as 'setting for ecc error threshold: 
available settings are 1, 4, 10 and 1000. the default setting is 1 for evt, dvt 
and pvt and 1000 for mp. setting for ecc error event log threshold: 
available settings are disabled, 10, 50, 100. the default setting is 10' in 
clause 6.3.2. 
– [b-ocp 2s] provides memory reliability as 'both correctable ecc and 
uncorrectable ecc errors should be logged into sel. each log entry should 
indicate location of dimm by cpu socket#, channel # and slot #. memory 
error reporting need to be tested by both xdp injection and reworked ecc 
dimm' in clause 9.11.1. 
– [b-ocp ambh] provides memory reliability as 'setting for ecc error 
threshold, available settings are 1, 4, 10 and 1000' in clause 5.5. 
– [b-ocp ambh] provides memory reliability as 'cpu/memory errors: both 
correctable ecc and uncorrectable ecc errors should be logged into event 
log. error categories include dram, hypertransport link and l3 cache' in 
clause 5.10.1. 
 [b-ocp hsch] provides memory reliability as 'memory correctable ecc: the 
threshold value is 1000. when the threshold is reached, the bios logs the 
event and includes the physical dimm location.' in clause 8.5.10. 
– [b-ocp imbh] provides memory reliability as 'ddr3 direct attached memory 
support on cpu0 and cpu1 with: 4 channel ddr3 registered memory 
interface on processors 0 and 1; 2 ddr3 slots per channel per processor 
(total of 16 dimms on the motherboard); rdimm/lv-rdimm (1.5v/1.35v), 
lrdimm and ecc udimm/lv-udimm(1.5v/1.35v); single, dual and quad 
rank dimms ; ddr3 speeds of 800/1066/1333/1600 mhz; up to maximum 
512 gb memory with 32gb rdimm dimms' in clause 4.3. 
– [b-ocp imbh] provides memory reliability as 'cpu/memory errors: both 
correctable ecc and un-correctable ecc errors should be logged into the 
event log. error categories include dram, link and l3 cache' in clause 5.9.1. 
– [b-ocp imbh] provides memory reliability as 'memory correctable ecc: the 
threshold value is 1000. when the threshold is reached, the bios should log 
the event including dimm location information and output dimm location 
code through the debug card' in clause 5.9.2. 
8 supporting various 
types of memory 
– [b-ocp 2s] provides supporting of various types of memory as 'besides 
traditional ddr4 dimm, the motherboard shall support non-volatile dimm 
(nvdimm) on all dimm slots' in clause 5.3.3. 
– [b-ocp ambh] provides supporting of various types of memory as  'ddr3 
direct attached memory support on cpu0 and cpu1 with: o 4 channels ddr3 
registered memory interface on each cpu; 2 ddr3 slots per channel per 
processor (total of 16 dimms on the motherboard); rdimm/lv-rdimm 
(1.35v/1.25v), lrdimm and udimm/lv-udimm (1.35v/1.25v); sr, dr and 
qr dimms; ddr3 speeds of 800/1066/1333/1600; up to maximum 512gb 
memory with 32gb rdimms' in clause 4.3. 
– [b-ocp hsas] provides supporting of various types of memory as  'dimm 
type: rdimm ddr4, lrdimm 3ds ddr4, lrdimm ddr4' in clause 8. 
– [b-ocp imbh] provides supporting various types of memory a s 'ddr3 direct 
attached memory support on cpu0 and cpu1 with: 4 channel ddr3 
registered memory interface on processors 0 and 1; 2 ddr3 slots per 
channel per processor (total of 16 dimms on the motherboard); rdimm/lv -
rdimm (1.5v/1.35v), lrdimm and ecc udimm/lv-udimm(1.5v/1.35v); 
single, dual and quad rank dimms ; ddr3 speeds of 800/1066/1333/1600
