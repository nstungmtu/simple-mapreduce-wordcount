 framework and requirements for cloud computing 1 
 
   53 
the ccra is also intended to: 
• facilitate the understanding of the operational intricacies of cloud computing; 
• illustrate and provide understanding of various cloud services and their provisioning and use; 
• provide a technical reference to enable  the international community to understand, discuss, 
categorize and compare cloud services; 
• be a tool for describing, discussing, and for developing a system -specific architecture using a 
common framework of reference; 
• facilitate the analysis of candidate standards in areas including security, interoperability, portability, 
reversibility, reliability and service management, and support analysis of reference 
implementations. 
7 reference architecture concepts 
this recommendation | international standard d efines a ccra that can serve as a fundamental reference 
point for cloud computing standardization and which provides an overall framework for the basic concepts 
and principles of a cloud computing system. 
this clause provides an overview of the architectur al approaches that are used in this recommendation | 
international standard. 
7.1 ccra architectural views 
cloud computing systems can be described using a viewpoint approach. 
four distinct viewpoints are used in the ccra (see figure 7-1): 
• user view; 
• functional view; 
• implementation view; and 
• deployment view. 
 
figure 7-1 – transformations between architectural views 
table 7-1 provides a description of each of these views.  
table 7-1 – ccra views 
ccra view description of the ccra view scope 
user view the system context, the parties, the roles, the sub-roles 
and the cloud computing activities 
within scope 
functional view the functions necessary for the support of cloud 
computing activities 
within scope 
implementation view the functions necessary for the implementation of a 
cloud service within service parts and/or infrastructure 
parts 
out of scope
