figure 7-5 â€“ high-level procedural flows for image uploading from surveillance camera 
figure 7-5 shows the procedural flows of the image uploading from the pu to the cloud storage system: 
(1) the cu initiates an image storage request and sends this request to the scu. 
(2) the scu forwards this image uploading plan request to the cmu. 
(3) the cmu authenticates the uploading access permission and then sends this uploading plan request 
to the csmu. 
(4) the csmu authenticates the uploading access permission and then sends this uploading plan 
request to the csau. 
(5) the csau returns a response to the csmu when it is ready for this uploading plan. 
(6) the csmu returns the csau information to the cmu. 
(7) the cmu sends a response to the scu. 
(8) the scu forwards this response to the cu. 
(9) when the cu receives the csau information, it sends the image storage request to the csau. 
(10) when the csau receives the request, it sends a request to the scu for the data source address. 
(11) the scu forwards the request to the mdu. 
(12) the mdu returns the address to the scu. 
(13) the scu transfers the data source address to the csau.
