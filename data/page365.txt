7.7 open data 
open data is accessible public data that people, companies, and organizations can use to launch new 
ventures, analyze patterns and trends, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems. open data 
includes two basic features: the data must be publicly available for anyone to use, and it must be licensed in 
a way that allows for its reuse [b-theguardian]. open data is more focused on a horizontal scaling of big data 
sources. 
the main technical issues for open data are as follows: 
− data publication: metadata supporting machine readability, data format, and licenses; 
− data finding: data identification, data semantics, and data access; 
− data provenance: data quality, data lineage tracking, and data versioning. 
7.8 standardization areas of big data 
this clause describes the potential areas of standardization for big data that may be of interest to itu -t [b-
itu-t tsag]: 
− common requirements and use cases; 
− definition, architecture, data model and application program interfaces (apis); 
− network-driven data analytics; 
− personalized network experience; 
− security and data protection, anonymization and de-identification of personal data; 
− framework for data quality and veracity; 
− standards and guidelines to address issues surrounding legal implications of big data in the 
telecommunications sector (e.g., data ownership); 
− framework and related standards for telecom big data exchange. 
8 conceptual model of big data ecosystem 
[itu-t y.3600] describes the roles and sub-roles of the big data ecosystem as shown in figure 8-1. 
 
figure 8-1 – big data ecosystem (from [itu-t y.3600]) 
data provider (dp) roles consists of two sub-roles: 
− data supplier; 
− data broker.
