figure 7-6 â€“ high-level procedural flows for video metadata or image metadata storage 
figure 7-6 shows the procedural flows of the video metadata or image metadata storage in cloud storage 
system: 
(1) the cu initiates a storage plan request and sends this request to the scu. 
(2) the scu forwards this storage plan request to the cmu. 
(3) the cmu authenticates the storage access permission and then sends this storage plan request  to 
the csmu. 
(4) the csmu authenticates the storage access permission and then sends this storage plan request to 
the csau. 
(5) the csau returns a response to the csmu when it is ready for this storage plan. 
(6) the csmu returns the csau information to the cmu. 
(7) the cmu sends a response to the scu. 
(8) the scu forwards this response to the cu. 
(9) when the cu receives the csau information, it sends the video metadata or image metadata 
storage request to the csau. 
(10) when the csau receives the storage request, it sends a request to the scu for the metadata 
address.
