table ii.5 – hierarchical caching of cloud service images 
use case 
therefore, hierarchical caching is needed. cloud service images are cached on the regional cloud 
according to the initial request or frequency. it is helpful to reduce the load on the core cloud 
because multiple regional clouds handle the requests respectively. it also mitigates the capacity 
issue on the edge cloud, and it provides fast service deployment to support real -time 
performance by reducing latency than from the core cloud.
