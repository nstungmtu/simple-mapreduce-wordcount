1 scope 
this recommendation provides the network as a service (naas) functional architecture by specifying 
functionalities and functional components as well as reference points for the operation support system (oss). 
the scope of this recommendation consists of: 
– overview of the naas functional architecture; 
– naas functionalities; 
– naas functional components; 
– oss reference points in the naas functional architecture. 
this recommendation also provides appendixes describing: 
– the mapping between naas functionalities described in this recommendation and naas functional 
requirements specified in [itu-t y.3512]; 
– the relationship between the naas functional architecture and software-defined networking (sdn); 
– an illustrated usage of sdn and network functions virtualization (nfv) in support of the naas 
functional architecture.
