attributes of read/write caching, snapshot, replication, fragmentation, etc. 
– storage operation metadata is a description required to perform storage operations. it includes the 
location of dsf local stora ge, interface, api for customer data operation, read/write speed, storage 
capacity, etc. 
6.4 ecosystem of data storage federation  
this clause identifies roles and sub -roles of the dsf ecosystem. in addition, relationships among roles and 
sub-roles are specified.  
 
figure 6-4 – data storage federation ecosystem 
dsf service is a service to provide single virtual volumes and policies and it is offered by a dsf service 
provider. 
the dsf ecosystem includes the following roles as shown in figure 6-4:  
– dsf service customer;  
– dsf service provider;  
– dsf local storage provider.  
6.4.1 dsf service customer

the dsf service provider role consists of two sub-roles: 
– storage federation provider;  
– data manipulation provider.  
6.4.2.1 storage federation provider
