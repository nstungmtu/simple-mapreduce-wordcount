ii.3.3 test case: network address translation 
table ii.24 shows the test case for network address translation. 
table ii.24 – test case: network address translation 
network address translation test description 
test purpose to verify that the csc configures the mapping between an internal ip address and 
external ip address of a specific vm. 
reference [itu-t y.3513] clause 7.3.3 
test sequence step type description result 
 1 stimulus the csc configures nat to map the vm's private network 
address to the public network address.  
 
2 check the private ip address of the vm is translated to specify a 
public address while accessing the internet. 
 
3 stimulus the csc configures nat to map the public network address 
to the vm's private network address. 
 
4 check the public ip address of the vm is translated to the private 
network address. 
 
test verdict it is deemed as successfully terminated if all the checks are successful, otherwise it is 
deemed as failed. 
 
ii.3.4 test case: network isolation 
table ii.25 shows the test case for network isolation. 
table ii.25 – test case: network isolation 
network isolation test description 
test purpose to verify that the csc's tenant network is isolated even though the network address is 
overlapped with another tenants' network. 
reference [itu-t y.3513] clause 7.3.4 
test sequence step type description result 
1 stimulus the csc logs in as tenant a and creates a vm called vm a.   
2 stimulus the csc creates a vm called vm c assigned with the network 
address of the same subnet as vm a. 
 
3 stimulus the csc logs in as tenant b and creates a vm called vm b 
assigned with the network address of the same subnet as vm 
a.  
 
4 check vm a can communicate with vm c.   
5 check vma and vm b cannot communicate with each other.  
test verdict it is deemed as successfully terminated if all the checks are successful, otherwise it is 
deemed as failed.
