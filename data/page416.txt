• iso/iec 22123: this document provides a consolidated set of terms and definitions extracted from 
the iso/iec cloud computing standards, including, but not limited to, iso/iec 17788, iso/iec 17789, 
iso/iec 19086, iso/iec 19941 and iso/iec 19944. in addition, relevant and stable terminology from 
non-cloud computing iso sources (e.g., information technology – security techniques) and external 
organization are also included. this document also contains terms and definitions that are not 
necessarily contained in other works. this document also address es discrepancies and 
inconsistencies that have been identified in the consolidated terms and definitions to further 
enhance the usability of the iso cloud computing terminology. this document includes additional 
descriptions and clarifications of cloud com puting vocabulary terms, concepts and their inter -
relationships.

• iso/iec 22624: this document: 
– describes a framework for the structured expression of data -related policies and practices in the 
cloud computing environment, based on the data taxonomy in iso/iec 19944; 
– covers expression of data-related policies and practices including, but not limited to, the following: 
• data geolocation: location of data in various jurisdictions, as it applies to data at rest; 
• cross-border control of data: control of data that resides in different jurisd ictions or under 
different sovereign control depending on their data categorization (iso/iec 19944), and/or 
classification hierarchy and data use statement structure (iso/iec 19944); 
• cross-border flow of data: flow of data across borders and in general a cross various 
jurisdictions; 
• data portability: portability requirements of data in the cloud computing environment; 
• data classification: policies and practices which vary depending on the classification of the data; 
• data processing: processing of the data either by the csp or by a 3rd party; 
• data management: management of the data either by the csp or by a 3rd party; 
• data governance: governance of the data; 
– describes how the framework can be used in code(s) of conduct for practices regarding data at rest 
and in transit, including cross-border transfer of data, as well as remote access to data; 
– provides guiding principles on application of the taxonomy for the handling of data based on data 
subcategory and classification, including the processes  that are needed for data in different levels 
of categorization and classification; 
– provides use cases for data sovereignty challenges, i.e. control, access and location of data according 
to data categories just in-time elevations in data access for people in various roles (e.g., data centre 
operators and administrators, and other roles in cloud computing). 
 this document is applicable primarily to cloud service providers, cloud service customers and cloud 
service users, but also to any person or organiza tion involved in legal, policy, technical or other 
implications of taxonomybased data management in cloud services.

• iso/iec tr 22678: this document provides guidance on the use of international standards as a tool 
in the development of those policies that govern or regulate cloud service providers (csps) and cloud 
services, and those policies and practices that govern the use of cloud services in enterprise 
organisations. this includes material that explains cloud computing concepts and the role of cloud 
computing international standards in formulating polic ies and practices. the document makes 
reference to various international standards. where possible, these standards are iso/iec 
documents. where a suitable iso/iec standard is not available, references are made to documents 
published by other wto-registered standards bodies. as explained in the wto "technical barriers 
to trade" (tbt) agreement, standards play a vital role in supporting technical regulations and 
conformity assessment, however this document does not cover matters of trade.
