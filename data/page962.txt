7.1.5 software-defined networking 
software-defined networking (sdn) is a concept that enables network operators and data centres to flexibly 
manage their networking equipment using software. sdn introduces new levels of flexibility and automation 
without manual interaction for networking. 
7.1.5.1 software-defined networking-based network 
network setup in sdn is now separated from a network engineer's regular activities; network issue 
troubleshooting and diagnosis have become more complex. the availability, performance, utilization and 
capacity of sdn monitoring can enable a cloud computing provider more confidently to adopt sdn in cloud 
computing.

7.1.5.2 service chain 
cloud computing provides not only computing and storage resources to consumers as a resource pool, but 
also as a network resource pool. according to appointed service logic, network traffic passes though several 
service points (generally reference is made to firewall, load balance or any other network functions (nfs)). a 
service chain (sc) links these service points together. a cloud computing provider should consider 
the ’performance and status of an sc when it provides service to consumers.
