reference model for future recommendations, e.g., on the performanc e of dc power feeding 
systems. this recommendation describes extended power feeding architectures using up to 400 
vdc, e.g., hybrid redundant dc and ac power feeding based on recommendation itu-t l.1201.

• itu-t l.1220 : this recommendation provides an overview of evolution of energy storage for 
stationary use for ict/telecommunication equipment. global results of investigations from 
laboratory and field tests of solutions for site, network, data centre and cpe resilience in smart 
sustainable cities. mobile and portable batteries are out of the scope of this recommendation.

 itu-t l.1206 : the document discusses multiple power interfaces to ict equipment operated by 
standardized –48v direct current, alternating current source and direct current source up to 400 v 
in line with the interfaces, operational voltage and characteristics detailed w ithin itu -t 
recommendation and etsi relevant standards. it also includes some details on the power 
architecture within the ict equipment between the ict power interface and the ict end load.
