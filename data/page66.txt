functional components of the multi-layer functions are described in clause 9.2.5. 
7.4 relationship between the user view and the functional view 
figure 7-5 illustrates how the user view provides the set of cloud computing activities that are represented 
within the functional view (and realized using the technologies of the implementation view).

figure 7-5 – from user view to functional view 
further details on the relationship between the user view and functional view can be found in clause 10. 
7.5 relationship of the user view and functional view to cross-cutting aspects 
cross-cutting aspects, as their name implies, apply across both the user view and across the functional view 
of cloud computing. 
cross-cutting aspects apply to roles and sub-roles in the user view and they directly or indirectly affect the 
activities which those roles perform. 
cross-cutting aspects also apply to the functional components within the functional view, which are used 
when performing the activities described in the user view. 
cross-cutting aspects of cloud computing described in clause 8.5 include: 
• auditability; 
• availability; 
• governance; 
• interoperability; 
• maintenance and versioning; 
• performance; 
• portability; 
• protection of personally identifiable information; 
• regulatory; 
• resiliency; 
• reversibility; 
• security; 
• service levels and service level agreement.
