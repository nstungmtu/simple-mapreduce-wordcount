no. function description 
1 create policy the csp creates a naas service operational policy data model on the npap based on 
the required policy parameters and the npip stores it with the allocated labels which 
indicates its dimensions. 
2 delete policy the csp deletes the specified naas service operational policy data model on the npap 
and the npip removes it from the repository. 
3 update policy the csp updates a naas service operational policy data model on the npap based on 
the new policy parameters and the npip re-stores it and the original one is 
overwritten accordingly. 
4 get policy the npdp requests the specified naas service operational policy data model from the 
npip and gets it from the repository. 
5 distribute policy the npdp distributes the specified naas service operational policy data model to the 
npep and the npep makes the subscription on the npdp for its update.  
6 list policy the npip lists all the naas service operational policy data models on demand. 
7 retrieve policy the npip provides the retrieved naas service operational policy data models on 
demand based on the specified retrieval conditions. 
8 enforce policy the npep enforces the naas service operational policy data models based on the 
trigger condition or request.
