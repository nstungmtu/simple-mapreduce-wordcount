9.3 w3c 
the world wide web consortium (w3c) big data community explores emerging big data pipelines and 
discusses the potential for developing standard architectures, apis, and languages that will improve 
interoperability, enable security, and lower the overall cost of big data solutions. in addition, this group will 
also develop tools and methods that will enable: 
− trust in big data solutions; 
− standard techniques for operating on big data; and 
− increased education and awareness of accuracy and uncertainties as sociated with – applying 
emerging techniques to big data [b-w3c-bdcg]. 
the w3c open government community group's mission is to discuss and prepare data and api specifications 
relating to open government information. this group defines various serialization s of the specifications, 
including but not limited to resource description framework  (rdf) and java script object notation  (json) 
[b-w3c-ogcg].
