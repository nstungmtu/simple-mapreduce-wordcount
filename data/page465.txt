3) management controller function set: it contains multiple controlling func tions that supports the 
running of the cloud-based network management platform, and each function can be implemented 
by a small function block. some basic function blocks in the controllers are listed below. 
– vm monitoring function: it provides the ability to monitor the performance of vms. it monitors 
the dynamic information of the running status of vms. when performance degradation is 
detected, the monitor informs the controller to handle the resource reassignment or service 
transportation. 
– management service analysis function: it provides the ability of analyzing each management 
services in network management. each management service is registered in this analyzer, and 
all the related information about this service is analyzed and storage for future use. 
– management service deployment function: it provides the ability of deploying required services 
for a management task. each management task may need the support of multiple management 
services, and for those services which are not ready for use will appropriately be deployed into 
some virtualized resources on the cloud infrastructure. 
– management service composing function: it provides the ability of composing several small 
management functions into a new complex management service, so that they can easily provide 
a new type of management functionality without having to change the implementation of the 
component management functions. 
– more function blocks can be extended to support the running of the cloud -based network 
management architecture. 
4) management service function set: it provides management functions to network operators, and 
they are composed of all kinds of small management functions. each network management function 
is performed by a service application, and those management functions can form composed services 
that provide more complex network management functions. most management service applications 
are applications specific to a network technology, but there are still some applications which are 
more general to be used across different network technologies. in such cases, the common service 
application will be reused.  
7.4 the relationship between the components in the architecture 
this clause will introduce the relationship between the components in the architecture.
