i.5 policy-driven provisioning and management of data 
title policy-driven provisioning and management of data 
description dsf service provider provides a unified interface to use dsf local storage and options to set 
data manipulation policies. dsf service provider configures the data manipulation policies 
because the data manipulation policies are independent from multiple data storages in dsf 
local storage. dsf service customer uses a single virtual volume (e.g., upload, download, copy, 
modify, delete and so on) and sets data manipulation policies (e.g., non -sharing, read-only, 
overwrite, replicate and so on) to saved files. dsf service provider applies data manipulation 
policies onto data operation metadata. dsf service provider manipulates data by 
corresponding functions and apis with data manipulate policies. 
dsf service customer #1 sets data manipulation policy. dsf service provider modifies data 
operation metadata of target data. another dsf service customer (e.g., dsf service customer 
#2) searches and gets data by using catalogue. in this procedure, the data operation metadata 
is used in order to lookup data from dsf local storage.
