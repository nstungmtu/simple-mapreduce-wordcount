there are three different cloud computing capabilities types:  
• infrastructure capabilities type ; 
• platform capabilities type ; 
• application capabilities type. 
different cloud capabilities types have different interoperability testing.  
table 6-1 shows the potential interoperability testing target areas of cloud computing  with different cloud 
computing capabilities types . it is useful to identify the target areas . each target area should include 
functional testing as well as performance testing.

target area d:csp – 
legacy network 
   
"csc – csp" means interaction between csc and csp. 
"csp – csp" means collaboration among different cloud services. 
"csp – management interface" means consistent and interoperable management interface. 
"csp – legacy network" means collaboration with legacy network.
