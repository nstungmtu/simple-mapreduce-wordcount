figure 3 – detailed composition in the management service layer 
figure 3 shows the detailed composition of cloud-based network management functional architecture, which 
is a refinery of the components in the management service layer as shown in figure 2. 
the cloud-based network management functional architecture is composed of the following two main parts: 
cloud infrastructure function set, and the network management application function set. 
the cloud infrastructure function set include cloud physical element functions and a cloud hypervisor 
function above them. cloud physical element functions provide the basic functions of computing and storage. 
cloud hypervisor function provides the functionality to manage cloud physical elements, and provide 
virtualization functions above them. 
the network management application function set may be further d ivided into two parts: management 
controller function set and management service function set. management controller function set includes 
the basic supporting functions of the management platform, and also provide common functions to support 
management ap plications. management service function set provides management functions, which are 
divided into several aspects for network management, and usually they are application specific. 
7.3 the functions of each part in the architecture 
in figure 3, the functions of each component are further explained in this clause. 
1) cloud physical element function: this is the lowest level of cloud infrastructure, and it is usually 
composed of the functions provided by physical servers, computers, disks, network connectors and 
all other elements that form a physical cloud computing environment. they provide the basic 
computing and storage resources from the physical layer. 
2) cloud hypervisor function: it is a management layer over cloud physical element functions. cloud 
hypervisor function provides the management ability of virtualized resources, for example, 
creating/deleting a new virtual machine (vm), start/suspend a vm, and query/change a 
configuration of a vm, etc. cloud hypervisor function provides users virtualized re sources using a 
unified interface. from the users’ perspective, cloud hypervisor function can provide computing and 
storage capabilities dynamically, based on users’ requirements.
