note – composite multi -cloud applications can be written in a runtime and programming env ironment of choice, 
independent of the choice of cloud provider or cloud-deployment model. for example, use of java, node.js, php or .net 
in both private and public clouds. 
figure 4 – architectural vision for multi-cloud, multi-platform cloud management 
in figure 4, the applications executing in the virtual machines (vms) could be a composite, distributed 
application built from various software components. a vm instance could contain all software components 
that belong to such an application, or only some of them in the case where the application is distributed and 
executing in more than one vm (hence the references to applications or components in figure 4). 
the architectural vision shown in figure 4 enables interoperable applications to support cloud burst or hybrid 
cloud computing scenarios. 
7.2 functional requirements for end to end cloud resource management 
to meet the high level architecture of end to end cloud resource management described in this 
recommendation, a cloud computing platform should conform to the following requirements:  
• it is required that the csp supports the architectural and functional capabilities offered by the ses 
management approach in order to realize end to end cloud resource management. 
• it is recommended that the cloud comp uting platform offers the cloud deployment model 
[itu-t y.3500] choice and workload portability across multiple csps in order to share workloads. 
• it is recommended that the cloud computing platform provide the ability to support hybrid cloud 
applications, where the com ponents of the cloud application run on various cloud data centres 
managed by different csps. 
• it is recommended that cloud service provider, irrespective of t he cloud deployment model they 
use, provide the support for multiple application frameworks, pro gramming languages, tools and 
technology platforms, thereby lowering the potential for lock-in into specific solution or middleware 
technology. 
• it is recommen ded that the cloud computing platform provides an architecture enabling 
telecommunications-grade capabilities including reliability, fail -over and monitoring inclusive of 
choice of middleware, programming language and runtime.
