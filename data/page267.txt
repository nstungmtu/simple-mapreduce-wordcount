3.1.7 logical resource [b -itu-t y.3011]: an independently manageable partition of a physical resource, 
which inherits the same characteristics as the physical resource and whose capability is bound to the 
capability of the physical resource. 
note – "independently" means mutual exclusiveness among multiple partitions at the same level.  
3.1.8 management system [b-itu-t m.60]: a system with the capability and authority to exercise control 
over and/or collect management information from another system. 
3.1.9 virtual resource [b-itu-t y.3011]: an abstraction of physical or logical resource, which may have 
different characteristics from the physical or logical resource and whose capability may not be bound to the 
capability of the physical or logical resource. 
note – "different characteristics" means simplification or extension of the resource characteristics. "different 
characteristics" allows the virtual resource to expose access or control methods different from the original physical or 
logical resource.
