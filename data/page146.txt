appendix ii 
 
comparison analysis between cloud computing and data storage federation 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
table ii.1 shows the mapping between data storage federation ecosystem and the ccra user view. the dsf 
service customer has two sub-roles and these sub-roles are mapped onto the csc:cloud service user because 
two sub -roles have a relationship of using service. the dsf local storage  provider and c sp:cloud service 
manager and csp:cloud service operations manager, which provide data storage, are mapped in the 
perspective of providing service. however, for the dsf service provider, the additional considerations in data 
storage perspective are needed i n cloud computing. to federate and provide data storage from dsf local 
storages, such as cloud storage and non-cloud storage, they are properly described in csp as new sub-roles, 
activities and involvements.
