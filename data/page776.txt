7.4.5 operation management requirements 
– man-08: a vscc platform is required to monitor, record and display the running status of the 
system. 
– man-09: a vscc platform is requi red to monitor, record and display usage of cloud computing 
cluster resources. 
7.5 scalability requirements 
– sca-01: a vscc platform is required to provide computing resource scalability. when computing 
equipment is increased or decreased in the system, the computing capacity of the vscc platform is 
increased or decreased accordingly, and the system service is uninterrupted. 
– sca-02: a vscc platform is required to provide computing resources scalability for users. the 
computing resources of individual use rs can be increased or decreased according to each user's 
demand. 
– sca-03: a vscc platform is required to provide user scalability. the number of supported users can 
be increased or decreased dynamically. 
7.6 reliability requirements 
– rel-01: a vscc platform is required to ensure service reliability. when computing equipment fails 
or the system network operation is abnormal, the system service can be used normally. 
7.7 performance requirements 
– per-01: a vscc platform is required to support concurrent user operations. the system can serve a 
large number of users simultaneously, while ensuring service quality.
