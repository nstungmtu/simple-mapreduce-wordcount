1 scope  
this recommendation provide s a cloud computing framework by identifying high-level requirements for 
cloud computing. the recommendation addresses the general requirements and use cases for:  
– cloud computing; 
– infrastructure as a service (iaas), network as a service (naas), desktop as a service (daas), platform 
as a service (paas), communication as a service (caas) and big data as a service (bdaas); 
– inter-cloud computing, end-to-end cloud computing management, trusted cloud service, and cloud 
infrastructure. 
this recommendation addresses a set of use cases and related requirements which are included in 
appendix i. appendix ii provides information on the methodology and edition plan of this recommendation.
