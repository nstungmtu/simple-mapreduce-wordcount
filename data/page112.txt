a.3 the cloud service developer–cloud service provider relationship 
cloud service developers create and package service implementations and hand them to cloud service 
providers for deployment and operation. therefore, the cloud service developer interacts with the cloud 
service provider to:  
1) inspect the cloud service provider's environment for service execution; 
2) test service implementations; 
3) hand over service implementation packages. 
the development support functional components  support the cloud computing activities  of the cloud 
service developer, including the develop service, test service and maintain service cloud computing 
activities. these cloud computing activities depend on the development environment, build management 
and test management functional components. 
the lines in radiating from the developer environment component in figure a.7 show that the cloud service 
developer develops the implementation of a cloud service and composes the service using the development 
environment functional component and then uses the build management system to build the service and its 
related artefacts into a deployable package. the arrows to/from the test management functional component 
indicate that the test management system performs appropriate testing against the built package, fetching 
the package from the build management system and interacting with the provider's environment via the 
development access functional component to deploy a test version of the service and execute the tests.
