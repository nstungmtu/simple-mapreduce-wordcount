table iii.1 – alignment analysis with functional requirements in [itu-t y.3513] 
 
functional requirements in [itu-t y.3513] test objects in this recommendation 
36 7.3.1 network 
policy 
migration 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides network policy migration along 
with virtual machine migration. in this case, 
the network policy of the migrated virtual 
machine is the same as before the migration. 
– 9.1 interoperability testing of 
network policy migration between 
the csc and csp 
37 7.3.2 network 
qos 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides operation handling mechanisms 
related to the network quality of service 
(qos), such as bandwidth limit, bandwidth 
reservation, traffic shaping, traffic 
classification, congestion avoidance, at port 
level, device level and network level. 
– 9.2 interoperability testing of 
network qos between the csc and 
csp 
38 7.3.3 ip 
address 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides ip address reservation. 
– 9.6 interoperability testing of ip 
address reservation between the 
csc and csp 
39 
 
– it is required that the iaas csp allows the 
csc to apply, bind, unbind, query, release an 
ip address to processing resources or storage 
resources. 
– 9.5 interoperability testing of ip 
address allocation between the csc 
and csp 
40 
 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp allows 
the csc to allocate ip addresses to 
provisioned processing resources or storage 
resources with a dynamic or static method. 
– 9.5 interoperability testing of ip 
address allocation between the csc 
and csp 
41 
 
– the iaas csp can optionally provide network 
address translation (nat). 
– 9.3 interoperability testing of 
network address translation 
between the csc and csp 
42 7.3.4 network 
isolation 
– it is required that the iaas csp provides the 
csc with isolated tenants' networks. 
– 9.4 interoperability testing of 
network isolation between the csc 
and csp 
43 
 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
provides the csc with operations handling 
mechanisms related to isolated tenants' 
networks, such as create, query and release. 
– 9.4 interoperability testing of 
network isolation between the csc 
and csp 
44 7.3.5 virtual 
networking 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
manages virtual networking to provide 
network connectivity amongst various 
processing and storage resources. 
– 9.4 interoperability testing of 
network isolation between the csc 
and csp 
45 7.3.6 load 
balance 
– it is recommended that the iaas csp 
optimizes infrastructure resources utilization 
by providing load balance related functions, 
such as throughput, response time, to avoid 
overload of any one of the infrastructure 
resources. 
– 9.7 interoperability testing of load 
balance between the csc and csp  
46 
 
– the iaas csp can optionally provide 
multipath routing to achieve an optimized 
traffic management (e.g., to improve 
network utilization, to guarantee qos at 
network congestion or fault). 
– 9.9 interoperability testing of 
multipath routing between the csc 
and csp
