9.7 interoperability testing of load balance between the csc and csp 
the test object of load balance is to verify that the csc deploys a load balance mechanism for multiple vms 
in order to achieve scalability and fault tolerance of an application. the test case of load balance can be found 
in appendix ii.3.7. 
9.8 interoperability testing of firewall between the csc and csp 
the test object of firewall is to verify that the csc monitors and controls incoming and outgoing vm traffic 
based on predetermined security rules. the test case of firewall can be found in appendix ii.3.8. 
9.9 interoperability testing of multipath routing between the csc and csp 
the test object of multipath routing is to verify that the csc accesses cloud services through multiple network 
paths. the test case of multipath routing can be found in appendix ii.3.9. 
9.10 interoperability testing of network information inquiring between the csc and csp 
the test object of network information inquiring is to verify that the csc inquires network information from 
the csp with network device(s) specification, network traffic performance (in terms of throughput, jitter, loss, 
delay) and network topology. the test case of network address inquiring can be found in appendix ii.3.10.
