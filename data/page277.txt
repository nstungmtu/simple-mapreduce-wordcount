figure i.1 – cloud storage reference model 
note – the interfaces and protocols shown in figure i.1 are examples used for illustrative purposes.  
cloud storage is the cooperating operation of multiple storage devices, multi-applications and multi-services. 
not every storage system can be called cloud storage. a cloud storage system can provide functionalities 
such as a storage area network (san), network attached storage (nas), data backup and disaster recovery. 
as shown in figure i.1, the cloud storage reference model is composed of three sub -layers which are 
described in the following clauses.
