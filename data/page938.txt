specvirt_sc2010 measures the maximum number of workloads that a platform can simultaneously run while 
maintaining specific quality of service metrics. eac h workload consists of a specific set of virtual machines. 
the benchmark utilizes several spec workloads representing applications that are common targets of 
virtualization and server consolidation. scaling is achieved by running additional sets of virtual  machines, 
called "tiles", until overall throughput reaches a peak. 
spec release specvirt_sc2013, the new version of specvirt, was issued in  may 2013. it utilizes heavier and 
busier workload s and further stress the system's ability to meet the benchmark' s quality of service 
requirements. 
specvirt_sc2013 shares the general benchmark architecture from specvirt_sc2010, including the benchmark 
harness and most of the application workloads and vm types. heavier and more bursty workloads that 
require virtual machines with more memory and vcpus and further stress the system's ability to meet the 
benchmark's quality of service requirements have been added in specvirt_sc2013. 
many computer system vendors have submitted specvirt benchmark results to spec. 
5.2.2 open sources 
openstack 
openstack is a global collaboration of developers and cloud computing technologists producing the 
ubiquitous open source cloud computing platform for public and private clouds. the project aims to deliver 
solutions for all types of clouds by being simple to implement, massively scalable, and feature rich. the 
technology consists of a series of interrelated projects delivering various components for a cloud 
infrastructure solution.
