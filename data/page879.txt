• resource monitoring should be confirmed as follows: 
– resource information is exchanged in a standard manner among multiple csps; 
– updated resource information is exchanged among multiple csps in synchronization with the 
events involving the csps; 
– collecting information about the usage and performance status of the resources is exchanged 
among multiple csps periodically or on a request basis; 
– collecting information about the resource availability is exchanged among multiple csps 
periodically or on a request basis; 
– monitoring information in commonly defined ways is exchanged among multiple csps. 
• resource performance estimation and selection should be confirmed as follows: 
– the achievable resource performance that is available reserved resources in the secondary csps 
is exchanged between secondary csps. 
• resource discovery and reservation should be confirmed as follows: 
– csp can discover available resources of the peer csps; 
– discovered resources in the peer csps are reserved; 
– discovered resources in the peer csps are reserved provisionally; 
– available resources in the peer csps are found based on different priorities; 
– available resources in the peer csps are reserved on the basis of different priorities. 
• resource set-up and activation should be confirmed as follows: 
– reserved resources in a peer csp are established; 
– the configuration and policy settings of reserved resources in the peer csps are accessed. 
• cloud services switchover and switchback should be confirmed as follows: 
– the csc's end-user is switched over  access to a peer csp without manual operation from the 
csc, in order to allow the csc's end user to use services in a similar manner to the way he/she 
did before the access was switchover; 
– the csc's end-user access is switched back to the primary csp when this csp has recovered from 
the switchover 
• resource release should be confirmed as follows: 
– resources reserved, activated and/or set up in the peer csps are released by the csp; 
– the peer csp's resource configuration information are updated; 
– received cloud application data are erased and/or transferred back during the resource 
reservation. 
• csc information exchange should be confirmed as follows: 
– csc information is activated only with the prior agreement of the csc; 
– csc profiles and associated information can be managed; 
– csc profiles and associated information can be exchanged among multiple csps according to a 
pre-determined protocol and format, with the condition that the csc is informed of and agrees 
to the exchange. 
• primary csp role delegation should be confirmed as follows: 
– a csp is activated only with the prior agreement of the csc; 
– a csp is able to discover peer csps that are capable of inheriting the primary csp role, and to 
negotiate with these peer csps as to whether they can accept the inheritance; 
– a csp is able to transfer its management information associated with the primary csp role in a 
reliable manner to the peer csps that have accepted the permission transfer with that csp;
