3.1.4 cloud service [itu-t y.3500]: one or more capabilities offered via cloud computing invoked using a 
defined interface. 
3.1.5 cloud service customer [itu-t y.3500]: party which is in a business relationship for the purpose of 
using cloud services. 
note – a business relationship does not necessarily imply financial agreements.  
3.1.6 cloud service partner [itu-t y.3500]: party which is engaged in support of, or auxiliary to, activities 
of either the cloud service provider or the cloud service customer, or both. 
3.1.7 cloud service provider [itu-t y.3500]: party which makes cloud services available. 
3.1.8 governance [b-iso/iec 38500:2015]: system of directing and controlling.  
3.1.9 information security [b-iso/iec 27000:2016] : preservation of confidentiality, integrity and 
availability of information.  
note – in addition, other properties, such as authenticity, accountability, non -repudiation, and reliability can also be 
involved. 
3.1.10 integrity [itu-t y.3500]: property of accuracy and completeness. 
3.1.11 inter-cloud computing [itu-t y.3511]: the paradigm for enabling the interworking between two or 
more cloud service providers. 
note – inter-cloud computing is also referred as inter-cloud. 
3.1.12 service level agreement [itu-t y.3500]: documented agreement between the service provider and 
customer that identifies services and service targets. 
note 1 – a service level agreement can  also be established between the service provider and a supplier, an internal 
group or a customer acting as a supplier. 
note 2 – a service level agreement can be included in a contract or another type of documented agreement.  
3.1.13 service management inte rface [itu-t y.3521]: interface that provides a set of management 
capabilities exposed by a cloud service through which the cloud service can be managed. 
note – for additional details of smi concepts, see [itu-t y.3520] and [b-tmf tr198]. 
3.1.14 trusted cloud service [itu-t y.3501]: a cloud service that satisfies a set of requirements such as 
transparency for governance, management and security so that a cloud service customer (csc) can be 
confident in using the cloud service. 
note 1 – the set of requirements will vary depending on the involved cloud service customer, the nature of the cloud 
service and the governing jurisdiction. 
note 2 – the set of requirements could also be related to additional cross -cutting aspects [itu -t y.3502] such as 
performance, resiliency, reversibility, slas, etc. 
note 3 – transparency means that the cloud service provider (csp) should commit to the csc that they have 
appropriate and clear control and reporting mechanisms for governance, management and security, suc h as sla 
commitments, online announcements, data handling policies, etc. 
3.2 terms defined in this recommendation 
this recommendation defines the following terms: 
3.2.1 dependability: the availability performance and its influencing factors on reliability performance, 
maintainability performance and maintenance support performance. 
3.2.2 inter-cloud governance: system by which the use of inter-cloud is directed and controlled.  
3.2.3 reliability: the ability of a system, product or component  to perform and maintain under stated 
conditions as required for a specified period of time. 
3.2.4 resiliency: the ability of a system, product or component  to provide, maintain, or return to an 
acceptable level of service in the face of faults (unintentional,  intentional or naturally caused) affecting 
normal operation.
