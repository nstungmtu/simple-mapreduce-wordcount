title video gaming service in trusted inter-cloud  
figure (optional) 
 
pre-conditions (optional) – the primary csp(intermediary) and secondary csps are in trusted inter -cloud 
relationship. 
– the csp1 and csp2 offer video gaming service (premium service).  
– the csp (intermediary) integrates and validates gaming services with qos. 
– the csp (intermediary) establishes service between csc and csp1.  
post-conditions (optional) – the csp1 is under internal or external perturbation and quality of video gaming 
service drops below premium service level. 
– the service is automatically established between csp(intermediary) and csp2 
without service interruption. 
derived requirements – real-time monitoring quality of trusted service 
– integrate and validate services from multiple csps 
– resiliency service from multiple csps 
i.2.4 use case of distributed image processing platform in trusted inter-cloud 
this use case illustrates the security and confidentiality aspects of trusted inter-cloud between a primary csp 
and secondary csps. the intermediary pattern of inter -cloud used to illust rate the use case is an 
example only. 
table i.2.4 – distributed image processing platform in trusted inter-cloud 
title distributed image platform in trusted inter-cloud  
description – the csc requests the csp for a platform to build image processing and 
storage systems. csc is required to provide its own part of the software into 
the cloud. 
– the csc request that the platform fits regulatory policy to reach safety, 
security and confidentiality constraints. the csc requests qos for data 
processing. 
– the csc requests that the physical location (localization) for its data store as 
well as csp can be chosen by csc in an elastic manner. 
– the primary csp(paas) in an inter-cloud intermediary pattern 
csp(intermediary) is the contact point for csc. 
– the csp(intermediary) integrates and validates saas services from multiple 
csps (secondary csps). 
– the csp2(saas) offers the same service as csp1(saas) or csp3(saas) but does 
not meet the required business regulatory policy. 
– for the csp(intermediary), in order to respect the request of a csc, it is 
necessary to validate security and confidentiality policies from secondary 
csp1(saas), csp2(saas) and csp3(saas). in case of negative validation, the 
secondary csp offer is not presented to csc.
