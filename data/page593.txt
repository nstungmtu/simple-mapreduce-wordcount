– configures a pre-configured virtual desktop environment (such as an os image and a user di sk 
image) and stores it to share for convenience and speed of the configuration; 
– installs and updates software in a pre -configured virtual desktop environment as well as a daas 
platform; 
– deploys a daas platform which scales up, down, and out including redundancy; 
 note 2 – if a heterogeneous virtualization infrastructure is adopted, this function deploys it  and prepares a 
new pre-configured environment compared with the previous user environment. 
– determines operating status of a daas platform and a virtual desktop according to csc type; 
 note 3 – based on the operating status, this function assigns  a previously allocated  virtual desktop, a 
temporary allocated virtual desktop, or a new ly created virtual desktop on the optimum daas platform  
according to csu's account information. 
 note 4 – the optimum daas platform has  best-efforts performance from the monitoring  of server power or 
performance among daas platforms. 
– identifies csc type and service catalogue. 
7.3 virtual desktop resource management 
virtual desktop resource management functions: 
– monitor and control states of virtual desktop resources (see clause 7.3.1 monitoring and controlling 
virtual desktop resource function); 
– manage user accounts and profiles in terms of administrators and daas users (see clause 7.3.2 user 
account and profile management function); 
– offer a virtual desktop and other resources to a daas user in a timely manner (see clause 7.3.3 virtual 
desktop resource allocation and distribution function); 
– establish operational policy (see clause 7.3.4 operational policy management for daas function); 
– offer high availability (see clause 7.3.5 high availability for daas function); 
– supply management of power consumption (see clause 7.3.6 power management of virtual desktop 
resource function). 
7.3.1 monitoring and controlling virtual desktop resource 
in the monitoring and controllin g virtual desktop resource function, monitored and controlled targets for 
daas are mainly virtualization infrastructure and virtual desktops. monitoring information is classified into 
static and run-time data. 
note 1 – the exchanged monitoring information is communicated through a protocol between a monitoring target and 
virtualization infrastructure. a software agent or daemon activated in virtualization infrastructure is used to gather 
monitoring information which is stored as a form of database or other file formats. this database is normally accessible 
by other functions. 
the monitoring and controlling virtual desktop resource function: 
– monitors the i nformation of virtualization infrastructure to gather by event processing during 
running daas; 
 note 2 – the monitoring information of virtualization infrastructure is as follows: 
• basic information of virtualization infrastructure: machine's host name, machine type; 
• hardware (h/w) resource for virtualization infrastructure: total memory space, the number of 
cpus, total storage space, machine's ip address, media access control (mac) address, the 
availability for performance enhancement, estimated power; 
• virtualization related resource: hypervisor information, the number of currently running virtual 
desktops, the supported maximum number of virtual desktops, supported oss. 
– monitors the information for each virtual desktop to gather by event processing; 
 note 3 – the monitoring information of virtual desktops is as follows:
