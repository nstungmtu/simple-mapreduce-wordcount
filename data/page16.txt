3.2.13 cloud service derived data: class of data objects under cloud service provider (3.2.15) control that 
are derived as a result of interaction with the cloud service (3.2.8) by the cloud service customer (3.2.11). 
note – cloud service derived data includes log data containing records of who used the service, at what times, which functions, 
types of data involved and so on. it can also include information about the numbers of authorized users and their identities.  it 
can also include any configuration o r customization data, where the cloud service  (3.2.8) has such configuration and 
customization capabilities. 
3.2.14 cloud service partner: party (3.1.6) which is engaged in support of, or auxiliary to, activities of either 
the cloud service provider (3.2.15) or the cloud service customer (3.2.11), or both. 
3.2.15 cloud service provider: party (3.1.6) which makes cloud services (3.2.8) available. 
3.2.16 cloud service provider data : class of data objects, specific to the operation of the cloud service 
(3.2.8), under the control of the cloud service provider (3.2.15). 
note – cloud service provider data includes but is not limited to resource configuration and utilization information, cloud service 
(3.2.8) specific virtual machine, storage and network resource allocations, overall data centre configuration and utilization, 
physical and virtual resource failure rates, operational costs and so on. 
3.2.17 cloud service user: natural person, or entity acting on their behalf, associated with a cloud service 
customer (3.2.11) that uses cloud services (3.2.8). 
note – examples of such entities include devices and applications. 
3.2.18 communications as a service (caas) : cloud service category  (3.2.10) in which the capability 
provided to the cloud service customer (3.2.11) is real time interaction and collaboration. 
note – caas can provide both application capabilities type (3.2.1) and platform capabilities type (3.2.31). 
3.2.19 community cloud: cloud deployment model (3.2.7) where cloud services (3.2.8) exclusively support 
and are shared by a specific collection of  cloud service customers (3.2.11) who have shared requirements 
and a relationship with one another,  and where resources are controlled by at least one member of this 
collection. 
3.2.20 compute as a service (compaas): cloud service category (3.2.10) in which the capabilities provided 
to the cloud service customer (3.2.11) are the provision and use of processing resources needed to deploy 
and run software. 
note – to run some software, capabilities other than processing resources may be needed. 
3.2.21 data portability: ability to easily transfer data from one system to another without being required 
to re-enter data. 
note – it is the ease of moving the data that is the essence here. this might be achieved by the source system supplying the data 
in exactly the format that is accepted by the target system. but even if the formats do not match, the transformation between 
them may be simple and straightforward to achieve with commonly available tools. on the other hand, a process of printing out 
the data and rekeying it for the target system could not be described as "easy". 
3.2.22 data storage as a service (dsaas): cloud service category (3.2.10) in which the capability provided 
to the cloud service customer (3.2.11) is the provision and use of data storage and related capabilities. 
note – dsaas can provide any of the three cloud capabilities types (3.2.4). 
3.2.23 hybrid cloud : cloud deployment model  (3.2.7) using at least two different cloud deployment 
models (3.2.7). 
3.2.24 infrastructure as a service  (iaas): cloud service category  (3.2.10) in which the cloud capabilities 
type (3.2.4) provided to the cloud service customer (3.2.11) is an infrastructure capabilities type (3.2.25). 
note – the cloud service customer (3.2.11) does not manage or control the underlying physical and virtual resources, but does 
have control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications that use the physical and virtual resources. the cloud 
service customer (3.2.11) may also have limited ability to control certain networking components (e.g., host firewalls). 
3.2.25 infrastructure capabilities type: cloud capabilities type (3.2.4) in which the cloud service customer 
(3.2.11) can provision and use processing, storage or networking resources. 
3.2.26 measured service: metered delivery of cloud services (3.2.8) such that usage can be monitored, 
controlled, reported and billed.
