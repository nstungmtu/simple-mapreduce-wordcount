administrator function functional component: 
• monitor service;

the administration access functional component  performs any authentication of the csc:cloud service 
administrator and establishes authorization to use particular functions of the administration capabilities 
functional component . the administration capabil ities functional component  interacts with operational 
support systems functional components to carry out requests made by the csc:cloud service administrator, 
for example, the monitoring and reporting functional component.
