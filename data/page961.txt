7.1.4 network 
high-performance computing requires large amounts of network bandwidth . particularly for cloud 
computing, the network has a strong meaning, as all provided resources and services are available through a 
network. it has been found that poor network performance is caused by virtualization i/o overhead. a 
network monitoring system helps in realization of traffic, utilization and errors and then, based on accurate 
monitoring information, quality of service (qos) policy validation, network outage resolution, performance 
problem troubleshooting, and in making important capacity planning decisions.

metric name description unit 
incoming bytes number of bytes received by network interface kb 
incoming byte rate average rate of bytes received by network interface per 
second kb/s 
maximum incoming byte rate maximum incoming byte rate during a specific period 
(5 minute/15 minutes/60 minutes) kb/s 
outgoing bytes number of bytes sent by network interface kb 
outgoing byte rate average rate of bytes sent by network per second kb/s 
maximum outgoing byte rate maximum outgoing byte rate (5 minute/15 minutes/ 
60 minutes) kb/s 
incoming packets number of incoming packets packet 
incoming packet rate average rate of incoming packets per second packet/s 
average packets size incoming average packets size incoming (1 minute/5 minutes/ 
15 minutes) byte 
outgoing packets number of outgoing packets packet 
outgoing packet rate average rate of outgoing packets per second packet /s 
average packets size outgoing  average packets size outgoing (1 minute/5 minutes/ 
15 minutes) byte 
outgoing errors sending error of network interface packet 
bandwidth of incoming  total capacity of the connection of the incoming  mb 
utilization of incoming interface percentage of incoming byte rate with respect to 
bandwidth of incoming. % 
bandwidth of outgoing  total capacity of the connection of the outgoing  mb/s 
utilization of outgoing interface percentage of outgoing byte rate with respect to bandwidth 
of outgoing link. % 
average latency average of delay of data transition ms 
minimum latency minimum time interval between submitting a packet and 
arrival at its destination ms 
maximum latency maximum time interval between submitting a packet and 
arrival at its destination ms 
packet loss percentage of packets lost with respect to packets sent. % 
jitter the difference in end-to-end one-way delay ms
