figure 8-5 – cloud computing activities related to cloud service partner sub-roles 
8.4.2.1 design, create and maintain service components 
the design, create and maintain service components activity involves: 
• designing and creating software components that are part of the implementation of a service; 
• creating the functionality which is offered to users of the service, which also involves connecting the 
service components to the provider's operational support systems, so that the service 
implementation can be monitored and controlled; 
• processing problem reports relating to the operation of a service implementation; 
• providing fixes to service implementations; 
• providing enhancements to service implementations. 
8.4.2.2 compose services 
the compose services activity focuses on composing services using existing services. this activity involves: 
• creating service functionality by means of composing together one or more existing services 
provided elsewhere; 
• describing the technical aspects of the service (functional interfaces, slas,…); 
• designing an interface to the cloud service customer  representing the composed services from 
across multiple cloud service provider offerings; 
• performing composition which can involve intermediation, aggregation or arbitrage of the existing 
services. 
8.4.2.3 test services 
the test services activity focuses on  testing the components and services created by the cloud service 
developer. this activity involves: 
• performing tests of the components that make up a service implementation to assure that they 
perform the functionality of the service completely and correctly; 
• ensuring interoperability with the cloud services provided by a peer cloud service provider; 
• testing which should include checking that the connections to the cloud service provider's  
operational support systems operate correctly – as a result, it is typically necessary to perform some 
of the testing in a test area of the cloud service provider's data centre.
