6.4 virtualization in physical machines 
this clause identifies different types of virtualization of the components in processing units such as cpus, 
memory and i/os. the mode of virtualization in each component can be software based mode or hardware-
assisted mode. the requirements in this recommendation only consider the hardware -assisted mode for 
virtualization. 
6.4.1 cpu virtualization  
cpu virtualization technology makes a single cpu act as if it was multiple individual cpus. there are different 
ways to implement cpu virtualization. cpu virtua lization can be implemented in software-based mode and 
in hardware-assisted mode:  
– in software based mode, the privileged instructions are simulated by software.  
– in hardware-assisted mode, the privileged instructions can be directly run by the physica l cpu to 
achieve higher performance. hardware-assisted mode requires the cpu to support a virtualization 
instruction set. 
note – the difference between the two modes is in the execution of privileged instructions in vm's operating system 
(os).  
6.4.2 memory virtualization  
memory virtualization abstracts physical memory to a divided virtual memory for use by a virtual machine. 
there are two  modes of memory virtualization: software-based and hardware -assisted memory 
virtualization: 
– software-based mode builds a software based memory mapping table.  
– in hardware -assisted mode, a memory mapping table is implemented in hardware with better 
performance. 
note – the difference between the two modes is the mapping between virtual memory and  physical memory.
