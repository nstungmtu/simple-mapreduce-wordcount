note – all metrics should be measured over different durations, e.g., 1  min, 5 min, 15 min or 30 min. 
7.1.2 virtual computing resources 
virtual computing resources include any virtual component within a virtual computer system for running an 
operating system, software and applications. similarly to physical computing resources, running data and 
status of resources from vms in which the applications are currently running re quire collection. these data 
provide a picture of how much of the vm is being utilized and helps in analysis and determination of the 
scaling requirement of applications.
