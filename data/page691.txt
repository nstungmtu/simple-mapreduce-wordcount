the oss-ns functional components encompass the set of operational-related management capabilities that 
are required in order to manage and control network services offered to customers as part of naas services. 
see clause 7.8.2.1 for a description of oss-ns functionalities. 
figure 8-4 shows the oss-ns functional components. 
 
figure 8-4 – oss-ns functional components 
the oss-ns functional components include: 
– ns catalogue; 
– ns provisioning; 
– ns monitoring and reporting; 
– ns policy management; 
– ns automation; 
– ns level management; 
– ns incident and problem management; 
– ns inventory. 
8.3.2.1 ns catalogue 
the ns catalogue functional component provides a listing of all network services of the naas csp. the ns 
catalogue contains and /or references all relevant technic al information required to deploy, provision and 
run a network service. 
8.3.2.2 ns provisioning 
the ns provisioning functional component provides the capabilities for provisioning network services, both 
in terms of the provisioning of network service imple mentations and of network service access endpoints 
and the workflow required to ensure that elements are provisioned in the correct sequence. 
8.3.2.3 ns monitoring and reporting 
the ns monitoring and reporting functional component provides capabilities for: 
– monitoring the activities of other functional components throughout the naas csp's system. this 
includes functional components involved in the support of network services, such as functional 
components in the oss-ns itself like the ns automation functional component (e.g., the provisioning 
of a network service instance for a particular customer). 
– providing reports on the behaviour of the naas csp's system, which can take the form of alerts for 
behaviour which has a time -sensitive aspect (e.g., the occurrence of a fault, the completion of a 
task), or it can take the form of aggregated forms of historical data (e.g., service usage data). 
– storage and retrieval of network service monitoring and event data as logging records.
