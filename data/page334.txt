figure 7-2 – an example scenario of cloud computing support for big data 
note – figure 7-2 considers cloud service categories based on table a.1 of itu-t y.3500. 
7.1.1 csn:data provider (csn:dp) 
csn:data provider (csn:dp) is the sub-role of the cloud service partner (csn) generating and publishing new 
data or information which feeds into the big data system for discove ry, access and transformation. the 
csp:data provider's activities include a generate data activity, a publish data activity and a brokerage data 
activity. 
7.1.1.1 generate data activity  
the generate data activity involves gathering data from several kinds of sources. the data can be generated 
in a variety of types such as structured data, semi-structured data and unstructured data. 
the data sources include public data (data from governments, organizations, internet, etc.), 
private/enterprise data and appli cation based data, such as s ocial network service  (sns) and internet of 
things (iot) data. 
7.1.1.2 publish data activity 
the publish data activity is the process of registering metadata of data to the csn. it provides metadata for 
brokerage data activity. 
note – metadata is delivered to the csp:bdip through brokerage data (see clause 7.1.1.3) with the data 
catalogue which includes data access methods, data use policy, etc. 
7.1.1.3 brokerage data activity 
the brokerage data activity involves providing metadata of data to the csp: bdip.  
types of brokerage data activities include: 
– providing a data registry to the csn:dp for publishing their data sources; 
– finding an on-line data source and registering its metadata; 
– providing a catalogue to the csp:bdip for searching appropriate data.
