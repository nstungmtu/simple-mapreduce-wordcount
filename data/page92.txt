9.1.1.4 resource layer 
the resource layer is where the resources reside. this includes equipment typically used in a data centre such 
as servers, networking switches and routers, storage devices, and also the corresponding non-cloud-specific 
software that runs on the servers and other equipment such as host operating  systems, hypervisors, device 
drivers and generic systems management software. 
the resource layer also represents and houses the cloud transport network functionality which is required to 
provide underlying network connectivity between the cloud service provider and the users, as well as within 
the cloud service provider and between peer cloud service providers. 
note that for a cloud service provider to provide services consistent with the sla, it can require dedicated 
and/or secure connections between users and the cloud service provider. 
9.1.1.5 multi-layer functions 
the multi-layer functions include a series of functional components  that interact with functional 
components of the above four other layers to provide supporting capabilities including and not limited to: 
• operational support systems capabilities (runtime administration, monitoring, provisioning and 
maintenance); 
• business support systems capabilities (product catalogue, billing and financial management); 
• security systems capabilities (authentication, authorization, auditing, validation, encryption); 
• integration capabilities (linkage of different components to achieve the required functionality); 
• development support capabilities (involving the creation, testing and life -cycle management of 
services and service components). 
9.2 functional components 
this clause describes the cloud architecture in terms of the common set of cloud computing functional 
components. a functional component is a functional element of the ccra whi ch is used to perform an 
activity or some part of an activity and which has an implementation artefact in a concrete realization of the 
architecture, e.g., a software component, a subsystem or an application.
