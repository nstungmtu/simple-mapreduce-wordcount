itu-t h.248.cloud, gateway control protocol: 
cloudification of packet gateways 
draft recommendation 07/2014 12/2018 
itu-t f.743.2, requirements for cloud storage in visual 
surveillance 
recommendation 03/2015 07/2016 
itu-t h.626.2, architecture for cloud storage in video 
surveillance 
recommendation 12/2015 12/2017 
• itu-t h.248.cloud: this recommendation does not define any new signalling extensions for the 
itu-t h.248 gateway control protocol. the purpose of this recommendation is to provide some kind 
of guidance to the specification of itu -t h.248 profiles for itu -t h.248 gateways i n cloud-based 
network solutions.

• itu-t f.743.2 : the purpose of this recommendation is to define the cloud storage service 
requirements in visual surveillance. cloud storage enables the service users to have ubiquitous, 
convenient and on -demand network access to a shared pool of configurable storage resources, 
which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service-provider 
interaction. cloud storage can realize flexible and reliable data storage for large -scale visual 
surveillance, and its components are modularized and allocated dynamically based on real usage. 
this recommendation provides the application scenarios and the requirements for cloud storage in 
visual surveillance.
