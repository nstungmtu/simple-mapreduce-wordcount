3 definitions 
3.1 terms defined elsewhere 
this recommendation uses the following terms defined elsewhere: 
3.1.1 activity [itu-t y.3502]: a specified pursuit or set of tasks. 
3.1.2 big data [itu-t y.3600]: a paradigm for enabling the collection, storage, management, analysis and 
visualization, potentially under real -time constraints, of extensive datasets with heterogeneous 
characteristics. 
note – examples of datasets characteristics include high-volume, high-velocity, high-variety, etc. 
3.1.3 big data as a service (bdaas) [itu-t y.3600]: a cloud service category in which the capabilities 
provided to the cloud service customer are the ability to collect, store, analyse, visualize and manage data 
using big data. 
3.1.4 cloud computing [b-itu-t y.3500]: paradigm for enabling network a ccess to a scalable and elastic 
pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on-demand. 
note – examples of resources includ e servers, operating systems, networks, software, applications, and storage 
equipment. 
3.1.5 cloud service [b-itu-t y.3500]: one or more capabilities offered via cloud computing invoked using 
a defined interface. 
3.1.6 cloud service customer (csc)  [b-itu-t y.3500]: party which is in a business relationship for the 
purpose of using cloud services. 
3.1.7 cloud service partner (csn) [b-itu-t y.3500]: party which is engaged in support of, or auxiliary to, 
activities of either the cloud service provider or the cloud service customer, or both. 
3.1.8 cloud service provider (csp) [b-itu-t y.3500]: party which makes cloud services available. 
3.1.9 functional component [itu-t y.3502]: a functional building block needed to engage in an activity, 
backed by an implementation. 
3.1.10 metadata [b-iso/iec 2382] : data about data or data elements, possibly including their data 
descriptions, and data about data ownership, access paths, access rights and data volatility.
