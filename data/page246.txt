1 framework and requirements for cloud computing  
 
238  
– on-demand network traffic control : it is required that a distributed cloud provid e on -demand 
network traffic control to mitigate congested network links among core, regional and edge clouds 
by reallocating routing paths and allocating bandwidth; 
 note 2 – the network bandwidth utilization inside a distributed cloud is substantially red uced with on -
demand network traffic control. 
– service routing: it is required that a distributed cloud support service routing for provisioning cloud 
service flowing to cscs; 
 note 3 – service routing is a unified service supporting platforms built on the  distributed service networking 
(dsn). it supplies the service registration, publication, discovery, triggering and access mechanisms, and 
enhanced capabilities to optimize the service. [b-itu-t y.2085] 
– context awareness: it is required that a distributed cloud provide discovery of context information 
for deploying and delivering cloud service requests to the best location among core, regional and 
edge clouds; 
 note 4 – discovery of context information is enabled by network functions.  
– high-speed network connectivity: it is recommended that a distributed cloud provide high -speed 
network connectivity to satisfy significantly higher data rates and data transportation among core, 
regional and edge clouds; 
– reliable network connectivity: it is recommended that a distributed cloud provide reliable network 
connectivity for seamless network links with low error rates and fast connection recovery from 
failures among core, regional and edge clouds; 
– network virtualization: it is recommended that a distributed clo ud support network virtualization 
for dynamic network deployment; 
 note 5 – network virtualization is a technology that enables the creation of logically isolated network 
partitions over shared physical networks so that heterogeneous collections of multipl e virtual networks can 
simultaneously coexist over the shared networks. this includes the aggregation of multiple resources in a 
provider and appearing as a single resource. [b-itu-t y.3011] 
– network services delivery : it is recommended that a distributed  cloud provide network services 
delivery wherever csc’s use cloud services. 
 note 6 – network service delivery includes virtualized network functions of switching, tunnelling, traffic 
analysis, and security such as load balancer, firewall and intrusion det ection. 
7.3 service requirements for distributed cloud 
– service mobility : it is required that a distributed cloud provide service mobility for supporting 
service level agreements (slas); 
 note 1 – for service mobility, the cscs' location detection and delivery of corresponding cloud services to the 
suitable distributed cloud resource automatically are needed for fast response time.  
– lightweight service: it is required that a distributed cloud provide lightweight cloud services for low 
power consumption resources at edge clouds; 
– context information update : it is required a distributed cloud support the updating of the 
associated context information periodically or aperiodically; 
 note 2 – see clause 6.2 for context information. 
– caching of cloud service image : it is required that a distributed cloud provide caching of cloud 
service images; 
 note 3 – frequently used cloud service images need to be cached in a regional cloud to deploy cloud service 
quickly to an edge cloud. 
– service mig ration: it is required that a distributed cloud provide service migration from one 
distributed cloud resource to another one; 
 note 4 – service migration refers to running cloud services reallocated to another distributed cloud resource 
by taking a snapshot.
