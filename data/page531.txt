provider edge (pe) devices. the service staff also collects configuration information such as port/frame/slot 
of pe  and the  pe id, and then send s the collected information back to the management system.  the 
management system then configures the network according to t his information, as well as the naas csc 's 
information (e.g., bandwidth, sla). the problem with this approach is that the service staff needs to collect 
the connection information and feed it back to the management system, and they must make sure that the 
collected information matches the actual connection. this process is error prone. 
new approaches should not count on the physical/ geographical information feedback by the service staff 
and should minimize the operation al procedures. the ce should send an authentication request (with 
credentials) to the pe, and the pe should forward the request to the management system, together with the 
port/frame/slot on which the request is received, the pe id, etc. the goal is that naas csp configures a vpn 
for an enterp rise naas csc to connect its enterprise network. the naas resource data model needs to be 
used in this scenario for modelling the physical nodes and links. 
the naas service data model, specifically for l3vpn, is needed to model the l3vpn attributes, including, but 
not limited to: tenant id, vpn site ids, vpn type and access bandwidth. 
here, the naas policy data model can be described as follows, using eca policy. 
– event: service management system receives a ce request for vpn creation (forwarded by pe); 
– condition: authentication and authorization results are acknowledged; 
– action: configure a vpn based on received request s, including the naas csc 's grade and physical 
information (port/slot/frame/route id, etc.) from which the request is received.
