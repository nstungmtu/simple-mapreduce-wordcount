title geographical policy in trusted inter-cloud  
figure (optional) 
 
pre-conditions (optional) – the primary csp(intermediary) and secondary csps are in trusted inter -cloud 
relationship. 
– the csp1(saas) and csp3(saas) effects geographical polices. 
– the csp2 performs saas service out of the requested area. 
post-conditions (optional) – the csp(intermediary) guarantees governance policies of saas.  
– the csp (intermediary) establishes service between csc and csp1(saas).  
– the csp (intermediary) establishes service between csc and csp3(saas) in case 
of failed csp1(saas). 
derived requirements – geographical policies 
– integrate and validate services from multiple csps 
– resiliency service from multiple csps 
i.2.3 use case of video gaming in trusted inter-cloud 
this use case illustrates the resiliency aspect of trusted inter-cloud between the primary csp and secondary 
csps. the intermediary pattern of inter-cloud used to illustrate the use case is an example only. 
table i.2.3 – video gaming in trusted inter-cloud 
title video gaming service in trusted inter-cloud  
description – the csc requests video gaming service with quality of service (qos) (premium 
service under sla). 
– the primary csp in an inter-cloud intermediary pattern (acts as 
csp(intermediary)) is the contact point for csc. 
– the csp(intermediary) integrates and validates video gaming services from 
multiple csps (secondary csps). 
– the csp(intermediary) monitors quality of service from secondary csp1 and 
csp2. in case service quality drops below premium service level, due to 
internal or external problems of csp1 (e.g., overloaded resources, human 
error, distributed denial of service(ddos)), the service is automatically 
established between csp(intermediary) and csp2 without interruption.
