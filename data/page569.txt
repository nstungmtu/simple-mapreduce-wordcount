daas client classification 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
daas u sers access their virtual desktops using networked daas clients, such as desktop computers, thin 
clients and mobile devices. basically, most of these devices rely on computing power in daas platf orms for 
all or a majority of their applications . several ways to access virtual desktops from daas clients can be 
provided. some daas clients support specific software dedicated to daas while some do not require specific 
software on the daas client and instead use a general web browser to interact with the daas platform. still, 
some daas clients can directly connect without any software or browsers. table ii.1 shows the characteristics 
of various types of daas clients, including these access methods
