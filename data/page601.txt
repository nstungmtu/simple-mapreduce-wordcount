• operational support systems functional component-monitoring and reporting: monitoring and 
controlling virtual desktop resource function (see clause 7.3.1) 
• operational support systems functional component -service policy management: operational 
policy management for daas function (see clause 7.3.4) 
• operational support systems functional comp onent-platform and virtualisation management: 
virtual desktop resource allocation and distribution function (see clause 7.3.3) 
• operational support systems functional component -incident and problem management: high 
availability for daas function (see clause 7.3.5), power management of virtual desktop resource 
function (see clause 7.3.6) 
• business support systems functional component -account management: user account and 
profile management function (see clause 7.3.2) 
there are four daas functions that are not mapped to any functional components in [itu-t y.3502]; they can 
be located in the layering framework as follows: 
– user layer:  
• connection negotiation function (see clause 7.4.2), c lient peripheral connection function (see 
clause 7.4.3), service continuity for user environment function (see clause 7.4.4) 
– multi-layer functions: 
• operational support systems functional component: p rovisioning and allocation of virtual 
desktop function (see clause 7.2.4) 
the detailed mapping is in appendix ii. 
since there are no reference points among functional components in [itu-t y.3502], it is necessary to adopt 
the grouping of daas functions in order to specify their reference points for convenience. clause 9 explains 
the reference points based on four grou ps of daas functions as in figure 7 -1, i.e., client support functions, 
virtual desktop connection and delivery functions, virtual desktop resource management functions, and 
virtualization infrastructure functions.

9.1 client support functions 
the client support functions (cs -fs) have four functions in cluding: connection negotiation function (cn -f), 
client peripheral connection function (cpc-f), service connection function (sc -f), and service continuity for 
user environment function (scue-f) as shown in figure 9-1. the cs-fs interfaces with only the virtual desktop 
connection and delivery functions (vdcd-fs).
