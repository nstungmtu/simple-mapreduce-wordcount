figure 2 – high level layering of cloud-based network management functional architecture 
figure 2 shows the high level layering of cloud -based network management functional architecture, which 
include the following three layers: 
– managed network layer: it indicates the layer containing all the network element functions (nefs) 
that are to be managed. the nes providing the nefs can be the traditional telecommunication 
network elements, or elements in a cloud infrastructure. 
– perception and control lay er (p&c layer): it indicates the perception function blocks and the ne 
controlling function blocks. perception function blocks have the capability to collect the 
configuration information, running status, or the performance data from the nefs, and the ne 
controlling function blocks can be able to make necessary reconfiguration or modifications to ne 
parameters, through interactions with the specified nefs. 
– management service layer: this layer mainly contains the network management function blocks , 
which provides management services to network operators.
