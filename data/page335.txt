7.1.2 csp: big data application provider (csp:bdap) 
the csp: big data application provider (csp:bdap) is a sub -role of the csp executing a set of data lifecycle 
operations to meet the requirements of data analysis and visualization, as well as the security and privacy 
requirements. the csp:bdap utilizes the services from the csp:bdip for big data services and provides 
analysis result to the csc: big data service user (csc:bdsu).  
types of csp:bdap activities include: 
– visualizing data; 
– analysing data. 
7.1.2.1 visualize data activity 
the visualize data activity is responsible for presenting data with multiple styles, such as statistical graphics, 
forms, diagrams, charts, reports, etc., through visualization and reporting tools and services. the big data 
service user (bdsu) can easily and quickly understand the meaning of data through data visualization. direct 
interaction between reporting tools and csc operational systems is also supported. 
types of big data visualize activities include: 
– business intelligence; 
– data reporting; 
– data exploration. 
7.1.2.2 analyse data activity 
the analyse data activity is a process to extract and discover useful information or valuable insights from big 
data.  
types of big data analyse activities include: 
– statistical analysis;  
– predictive analysis; 
– content analysis. 
7.1.3 csp:big data infrastructure provider (csp:bdip) 
csp:big data infrastructure provider (csp:bdip) is the sub -role of the csp providing cloud computing 
resources (such as system hardware, a network, storage and computing platforms) in order to execute big 
data processing, while protecting the privacy, retention policy and integrity of data.  
types of csp:bdip activities include: 
– performing data collection; 
– performing data storage; 
– providing data pre-processing; 
– providing data integration; 
– managing data protection; 
– managing data provenance. 
7.1.3.1 perform data collection activity 
the perform  data collection activity is responsible for gathering and sear ching of data. data in a cloud 
computing environment that could be transported through internet, such as web, video, audio, r adio 
frequency identification (rfid), sensor and social network data and data obtained in other ways can be 
categorized into three types as follows: 
– structured data, such as record data persistent in databases; 
– semi-structured data, such as data stored in xml, html and other format documents; 
– unstructured mass data, such as log files, video and audio data.
