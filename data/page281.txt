power management in cloud infrastructure 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
datacentres are amongst the highest consumers of electricity all over the world. one distinct advantage of 
cloud computing is it is also able to power-manage hardware and devices. therefore, the resources in a cloud 
infrastructure are recommended to be dynamically power-managed. the resources in cloud infrastructure 
are often arranged in trees. as some resources of a cloud infrastructure become idle, it can decrease power 
twigs or branches on trees. as the resource usage trends of cloud infrastructure are measured and controlled, 
it would be possible for these networks to put energy back into the grid by providing the grid with accurate 
time-based predictions of energy use. the gri d can use this information to redirect energy to other 
destinations, or make other intelligent decisions. 
power management in cloud infrastructure represents a collection of processes and supporting technologies 
geared towards optimizing datacentre perform ance against cost and structural constraints. this includes 
increasing the deployable number of servers per rack when racks are subject to power or thermal limitations 
and making power consumption more predictable and easier to plan for. 
power management i n cloud infrastructure comes in two categories: static and dynamic. static power 
management deals with fixed power caps to manage aggregate power, while policies under dynamic power 
management take advantage of additional degrees of freedom inherent in vir tualized cloud datacentres, as 
well as the dynamic behaviours supported by advanced platform power management technologies.
