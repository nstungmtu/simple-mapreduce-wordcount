relationship with related specifications from other sdos 
– [b-ocp hsch] describes how the bios is tuned to minimize card power 
consumption. it has the following features: • unused devices are dis abled 
including pcie* lanes, usb ports, sata/sas ports, etc.; • bios setup menu; 
• soc settings are provided to allow tuning to achieve the optimal 
combination of performance and power consumption' in clause 8.5.2.  
– [b-ocp hsch] describes how each card must provide temperature sensors 
for the soc, the so-dimm(s) (if they are used) and one ambient 
temperature sensor. all temperature readings for each sensor must be 
readable via the management sideband interface to the baseboard. 
additionally, over-temperature thresholds are configurable and an alert 
mechanism is provided to enable thermal shutdown and/or an increase in 
airflow. the sensors are accurate to +/−3c' in clause 5.4. 
20 interface for 
monitoring power 
– [b-etsi eve007] provides interface for monitoring power as 'each power 
supply unit should be capable of measuring and remotely reporting the 
following operational parameters' in clause 5.3.4.2. 
– [b-ocp 1s] describes how the twin lakes 1s server shall uses power sensor 
to measure card and soc power consumption. the power data can be used 
by the platform for power management purposes. the twin lakes 1s server 
supports an advanced configuration power interface (acpi)-compliant 
power button and reset signals from the platform, in clause 3 overview and 
clause 6.5. 
– [b-ocp ambh] describes how to use bmc to monitor power in clause 7.2 
and use pmbus interface to enable the bmc to report server input power in 
clause 8.6. 
– [b-ocp dsbs] describes how decathlete server board shall support power 
supply redundancy monitoring and support in clause 8.1.2. 
– [b-ocp tp] requires vendors to implement bmc firmware to support remote 
system power on/off/cycle and warm reboot through in-band or out-of-
band ipmi commands in clause 8.4 and support platform power monito ring 
in clause 8.8. 
21 cooling component 
replacement 
– [b-ocp 2s] describes that if and only if one rotor in server fan fails, the 
negative or positive dc pressurization can be considered in the thermal 
solution in the hot aisle or in cold aisle respectively in clause 10.2.4. 
22 cooling component 
redundancy 
– [b-ocp 2s] provides a description of fan redundancy which is one 
implementation of cooling redundancy – as 'the server fans at n+1 
redundancy should be sufficient for cooling server components to 
temperatures below their maximum spec to prevent server shut down or to 
prevent either cpu or memory throttling' in clause 10.2.5. 
– [b-ocp o1usm] requires fans to be n+2 redundant to optimize fan 
efficiency and server availability while eliminating the need for hot swap 
capability in clause 4.4. 
– [b-ocp o2usm] requires fans to be n+2 redundant to optimize fan 
efficiency and server availability while eliminating the need for hot swap 
capability in clause 4.4. 
– [b-ocp tp] describe how server fans should be n+1 redundancy to be 
sufficient for cooling server components to temperatures below their 
maximum spec to prevent server shut down or to prevent either cpu or 
memory throttling in clause 9.2.5. [b-etsi eve007] provides cooling 
component redundancy as 'redundancy within the rack cooling system shall 
provide appropriate levels of cooling to all the rack equipment while the rack 
cooling system is serviced' in clause 5.5.3.
