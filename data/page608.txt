10 security considerations 
security aspects for consideration within daas are addressed by security challenges for csp s and cscs , as 
described in [itu -t x.1601 ]. in particular, [itu -t x.1601] analyses security threats and challenges, and 
describes security capabilities that could mitigate these threats and meet security challenges. 
it is recommended that relevant security requirements of [b-itu-t y.2201], [b-itu-t y.2701] and applicable 
itu-t x-series, itu-t y-series and itu-t m-series of recommendations be taken into consideration, including
