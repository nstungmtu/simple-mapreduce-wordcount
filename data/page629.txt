development methodology of naas functional requirements and architecture 
(this appendix does not form an integral part of this recommendation.) 
considering the standardization me thodology and conventional study sequence, the abstractions of 
functional entities and their mutual interactions are base d on the functional requirements and the 
corresponding use cases analysis, which form a standardization body together. therefore, it is  required to 
progress naas functional requirements and architecture according to the following steps and priorities. 
step 1: use cases and functional requirements of naas which are included in appendix ii and clauses  7-9, 
respectively, of this recommendati on. note that all the functional requirements are derived from the 
corresponding use cases. 
step 2: functional architecture of naas should be based on this recommendation. 
additionally, the general requirements of naas are described in [itu-t y.3501].
